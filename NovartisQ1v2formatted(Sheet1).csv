"Our environmental sustainability strategy has three priorities:  
- Planet: Achieve climate and nature targets, including net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040  
- Patients: Develop sustainable products for patients, applying sustainable design principles for new products  
- People and policy: Transform the sustainability mindset across our organization and collaborate with industry partners to influence change in our sector  

Oversight of our environmental sustainability strategy, including climate and nature topics, ultimately lies with our Board of Directors.  
The Board has delegated certain duties and responsibilities to some of its committees, who report back to the full Board on their activities and findings.  

At management level, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is responsible for implementing the environmental sustainability strategy.  
The CEO chairs the ESG Committee, a management committee on all ESG matters, that reviews the company's ESG performance and strategy.  

Performance against ESG-related targets, including those on climate and nature, is integrated in the Executive Committee's compensation system as one of four equally weighed strategic objectives that account for $40 \%$ of the 2024 Annual Incentive."

Our purpose is to reimagine medicine to improve and extend people's lives by leveraging our scientific expertise to find new ways to treat and cure disease. Our strategy is to focus on high-value, innovative medicines that alleviate society's greatest disease burdens through technology leadership in R&D and novel access approaches.â€"
"Ultimate responsibility for our ESG strategy lies with the Board of Directors.  
The Board has delegated certain duties and responsibilities related to ESG to some of its committees.  
The primary responsibility for the oversight of the ESG strategy and governance is held by the Governance, Sustainability and Nomination Committee (GSNC).  
The GSNC oversees the company's strategy, governance and progress on sustainability, including access to products and services, environmental sustainability (including matters related to climate and nature), people management, and other ESG matters.  
The GSNC also discusses emerging trends and regularly advises the Board on ESG matters.  
The Audit and Compliance Committee is responsible for internal controls over financial and nonfinancial information, and reviews all performance indicators included in this report.  
The Risk Committee oversees the company's risk management, including risks related to ESG.  
The Science & Technology Committee is responsible for the oversight and evaluation of the company's scientific, technological, and R&D activities, which are relevant to our material topic of innovation.  
In addition, the Compensation Committee determines performance measures (including those related to ESG) for executive compensation and, together with the Risk Committee, reviews Novartis compensation systems to ensure they encourage behaviors that support sustainable value creation.

"Our ESG strategy is a fundamental component of our purpose to reimagine medicine and our strategic imperative to build trust with society.  
This strategy is integrated across the company to drive long-term sustainable value for stakeholders.  
We aim to be a sector leader, with a focus on the areas where we can have the most impact through our core business: innovation to tackle serious diseases and making sure our medicines are accessible in different health systems."
"The Ethics, Risk & Compliance (ERC) function provides an integrated ERM framework to obtain a holistic view of Company risks and drive a culture of smart risk-taking.  

Under the leadership of the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance Officer, the Corporate ERC team is responsible for the overall ERM process which is a fundamental pillar of our Integrated Assurance.  

This process covers, but is not limited to, risks associated with:  
- The research, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of products  
- Finance, taxes, intellectual property, compliance with law and regulations, security, product safety, technology, human resources, and health, safety and environmental protection  
- Business objectives and strategies, including mergers and acquisitions  
- External factors (e.g. risk amplifiers) such as the social, political and economic environment  

The ERM process continued to evolve in 2024. The Corporate ERC team conducted risk workshops and collaborated with all risk assurance and monitoring functions to identify key risks across the Company.  

Each Novartis unit organized a focused risk workshop including leadership team members. In parallel, risk workshops were held in top countries by revenue and in certain focus markets.  

Once key risks were identified, mitigation action plans were created to address them in an effective way.  

The findings from these workshops were consolidated into the Novartis Risk Radar, which enables senior management, the Executive Committee and the Board to focus discussions on key risks and more closely align our corporate strategy with our risk exposure and ways of working.  

In 2024, the Corporate ERC team further developed the ERM framework within the Novartis Corporate ERC organization.  

We developed additional risk management training and launched our risk intelligence forum, an event that brought together internal and external speakers to address emerging trends and threats.  

We also integrated a critical scope of activities (Trade Sanctions Governance) into the Corporate ERC team.  

Furthermore, steady progress has been made in our Integrated Assurance journey by creating a holistic control framework linked to enterprise policies, and by further strengthening our Corporate ERC Assurance team by integrating Labor Rights and Data Privacy External Partner Audits to ensure a harmonized and coordinated monitoring process across the Company."

""The result is a strong portfolio of innovative therapies that sets us up for sustained growth and finds new ways to improve and extend patients' lives."""
"2024 was a year of impact at Novartis.  
We reached nearly 300 million patients with our innovative therapies - more than ever before - as we built on the momentum from our successful transformation.  
We consistently delivered strong financial and operational performance, significant R&D achievements, and sustainable growth, and are well positioned to increase value for shareholders and society moving forward.  
Core to our approach is a relentless focus on innovation.  
It allowed us to develop and expand access to new treatments in our key therapeutic areas and technology platforms.  
We remain committed to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.  
We rank highly among industry peers in a range of key ESG ratings, and were honored to rank number one in the 2024 Access to Medicine Index.  
Fostering a culture of innovation depends on people.  
We aim to recruit, retain, and cultivate the best talent in the world.  
It's why we've rebuilt our organization to meet tomorrow's global healthcare challenges through a simpler organization, targeted hiring efforts and investments in new facilities to serve patients around the world."
"â€œIncreasingly, in addition to financial results, companies are being scrutinized by various stakeholders for their performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, which can impact the long-term sustainability of a companyâ€™s performance.  

An inability to successfully perform on ESG matters and to meet heightened and sometimes conflicting stakeholder expectations could result in negative impacts on our reputation, recruitment, retention, operations, financial results and share price.  

Topics related to large societal changes such as social inequity, access to medicines and climate change are increasingly important to a wide range of our stakeholders.  

For example, a variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized.  

In addition, investments in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments are popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such ESG measures in making their investment decisions.  

Our actions related to ESG topics may, in the long term, impact our operations and ability to achieve our strategic goals, and ultimately could have a potential negative impact on the value of Novartis.  

We actively manage a broad range of ESG matters, taking into consideration their expected impact on the sustainability of our business over time, and the potential impact of our business on society and the environment.  

Our Sustainability & ESG Office, under guidance of the ESG Committee of the Executive Committee of Novartis, is tasked with developing our ESG strategy and tracking our performance against our ESG targets.  

Considering the fast pace of change of external expectations, including a range of upcoming regulations, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, that the ESG standards we currently use to measure our performance against will remain the same, or that we will successfully meet societyâ€™s or investorsâ€™ expectations.  

Failure to meet rapidly evolving regulatory requirements, investor and societal expectations could also result in litigation or regulatory actions, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, recruitment, retention, operations, financial results, and share price.  

Additionally, partners in our value chain that we do not control may not comply with ESG commitments and goals we set for ourselves, which may have a negative impact on our business.â€"
"Therefore, a holistic effort â€” focused on patient-centered solutions, regulatory innovation, and shared accountability â€” is essential to bridging the gap between innovation and accessibility.

Failure to tackle these challenges collectively risks not only delaying access to medicines for patients but also impacting public trust, reputation, and business sustainability.

"To execute our strategy, we need to attract, develop and retain the most qualified people at all levels and in all functions.  
If we are unable to do so, our ability to achieve our business objectives may be affected.  
In addition, our brand and reputation could be negatively impacted, and the sense of belonging of our workforce may decline.  
Equally, as a global employer we have a significant impact on people, both within our organization and our upstream and downstream value chain.  
Our business generates employment with fair working conditions, and we provide extensive training and development opportunities and contribute to the wellbeing of our workforce.  
Meanwhile, investing in fostering belonging and a sense of wellbeing promotes innovation and better understanding of the unique and varied perspectives of customers, patients and other stakeholders.  
Our efforts in these areas are essential for our ability to identify, attract, develop and retain a highly skilled workforce.  
In addition, occupational health and safety incidents can occur, resulting in negative impacts on the workforce in our operations or our value chain."
"We are aligning our research, development and commercial activities around priority assets in our core therapeutic areas and integrating new technologies such as Al into our commercial models.  

We are also focusing on priority geographies that represent key sources of growth in our industry.  

R&D is vital to our strategy. Our ability to grow our business and advance our product pipeline depends in significant part on the success of our R&D efforts.  

We may be unable to develop the necessary clinical evidence to achieve the full potential of our assets.  

In addition, failure to successfully implement new technologies such as Al may put us at a competitive disadvantage and impact our productivity and pipeline value.  

We are focusing our efforts on core therapeutic areas and shifting more of our portfolio to new technology platforms such as cell and gene therapy, radioligand therapy, and xRNA.  

To do this, we need to have clear strategic objectives, be efficient and set clear priorities, with a focus on projects that have the highest potential.  

We also have a clear Al strategy and are investing in the enabling infrastructure, capabilities, and external partnerships needed to scale our most promising Al use cases across the R&D continuum.  

Building trust with society is part of our corporate strategy.  

We have developed an ESG strategic roadmap with clear targets on material ESG topics.  

We are also taking steps to further strengthen our approach to external partner ESG risk.  

We monitor changes to ESG regulations, particularly regarding new reporting and due diligence requirements.  

In addition, we have policies, controls and internal programs to ensure ESG is embedded in our decision-making."
"""We seek to price our medicines based on the value they deliver to patients, health systems and society.  
We believe this incentivizes health systems to focus on interventions that deliver the most effective, efficient and sustainable outcomes.  
We also work through industry associations to advocate for policies that support a sustainable ecosystem for innovative medicines.  

As part of our strategy, we may acquire and divest products or entire businesses and form strategic alliances and collaborations to strengthen our pipeline of new medicines and help sustain long-term growth.  

Delivering on our growth targets requires us to focus on priority brands and markets to support new launches and overcome potential barriers to the uptake of new medicines.

"We focus on four core therapeutic areas with strong growth potential and high unmet patient needs: cardiovascular, renal and metabolic; immunology; neuroscience; and oncology.  
This focus enables us to build depth in these therapeutic areas, leveraging our scientific expertise to find new ways to treat and cure disease, intervene earlier in disease pathophysiology, and improve quality of life for patients.  
We focus our exploratory research work in these core therapeutic areas, but also look beyond them, recognizing that cultivating a robust pipeline and remaining on the leading edge of scientific discovery requires a slightly wider aperture in early research.  
We are investing in technology platforms that we expect will deliver future high-value medicines.  
We focus on two established platforms (chemistry and biotherapeutics) plus three advanced platforms (radioligand therapy (RLT), xRNA, and gene and cell therapy) that will play an important role in delivering transformative new medicines.  
We focus on priority markets-US, Germany, China and Japan-which together account for most of the expected growth in global healthcare spending over the next five years.  
Although these are our priority markets, we maintain a strong presence in other markets worldwide.  

To support our focus areas, we have three strategic priorities:  
- Deliver high-value medicines to accelerate growth.  
- We aim to increase growth, driven by continued strong momentum in our existing portfolio of medicines including Entresto, Cosentyx, Kisqali, Kesimpta, Scemblix, Pluvicto and Leqvio and key upcoming launches.  
- Over the longer term, we expect growth will come through delivering high-value medicines that sustain and replace our existing growth drivers.  
- Our R&D strategy focuses on an end-to-end approach, covering research, development and commercialization.  
- We concentrate resources on priority programs to maximize early-stage potential and ensure effective late-stage execution.  
- We also focus on life-cycle management by enhancing the evidence base for key brands.  
- We increase our chances of discovering new medicines by collaborating with outside researchers and biotech companies.  
- Our network consists of academic and industry alliances working on joint research and drug discovery.  

Embed operational excellence to deliver returns.  
In an increasingly competitive environment, we are simplifying processes and reducing costs to become more efficient and effective in our decision-making and to free up resources for investment in new medicines.

"Fair value less costs of disposal reflects estimates of assumptions that market participants would be expected to use when pricing the asset or CGU, and for this purpose, management considers the range of economic conditions that are expected to exist over the remaining useful life of the asset.  
These valuations are classified as ""Level 3"" in the fair value hierarchy.  
The estimates used in calculating the net present values are highly sensitive and depend on assumptions specific to the nature of the Company's activities with regard to:  
- Amount and timing of projected future cash flows  
- Sales forecasts  
- Actions of competitors (launch of competing products, marketing initiatives, etc.)  
- Sales erosion rates after the end of a patent, loss of exclusivity or other intellectual property rights protection, and timing of the entry of generic competition  
- Outcome of research and development activities (compound efficacy, results of clinical trials, etc.)  
- Amount and timing of projected costs to develop IPR&D into commercially viable products  
- Profit margins  
- Probability of obtaining regulatory approval  
- Future tax rate  
- Appropriate terminal growth/decline rate  
- Appropriate discount rate  
Generally, for intangible assets with a definite useful life, Novartis uses cash flow projections for the whole useful life of these assets.  
For goodwill, Novartis generally utilizes cash flow projections for a three-year period based on management forecasts, with a terminal value based on cash flow projections usually in line with inflation rates for later periods.  
Probability-weighted scenarios are typically used.  
Discount rates used consider the Company's estimated weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific asset, country and currency risks associated with cash flow projections, to approximate the discount rate that market participants would use to value the asset.  
Due to the above factors, actual cash flows and values could vary significantly from forecasted future cash flows and related values derived using discounting techniques."
"Furthermore, our strategic alliances and collaborations with third parties may not achieve their intended goals and objectives within expected time frames, or at all. 

Similarly, we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully divest or spin off businesses or other assets that we have identified for this purpose; or that any completed divestment or spin-off will achieve the expected strategic benefits, operational efficiencies or opportunities; or that the divestment or spin-off will ultimately maximize shareholder value."

"In 2024, our primary focus areas included advocacy efforts supporting various initiatives and policies designed to advance healthcare, drive innovation and enhance accessibility.  
These efforts involved, for example, engagement with European Union institutions through EU institutional policymakers with special focus on the Critical Medicines Alliance, Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, EU Pharmaceutical Legislation, Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, and the Patent Package.  
These efforts aimed to strengthen supply chains, advocate for regulatory and intellectual property protections, enhance EU competitiveness, and support environmental goals.  
In the US, we engaged at both the federal and state levels to shape policies on drug pricing (e.g., the 340B program), the Inflation Reduction Act, and Pharmacy Benefit Managers reform.  
We emphasized engagement with policymakers, advancement of patient access, and efforts to uphold innovation and intellectual property protections."

"Due to the inherent limitations of any internal control structure, it is possible that errors or irregularities may occur in disclosures of the Sustainability Information and not be detected.  
Our engagement is not designed to detect all internal control weaknesses in the preparation of the Sustainability Information because the engagement was not performed on a continuous basis throughout the period and the assurance procedures performed were on a test basis.  
The nature of non-financial information; the absence of significant body of established practice on which to draw; and the methods of precision used to determine non-financial information, allow for different, but acceptable evaluation and measurement techniques and can result in materially different measurement, affecting comparability between entities and over time."
"Execute on operational excellence & productivity (10%)

- Workday, our Human Capital Management program was successfully launched on schedule in April.  
- AI tools and technologies were used to generate: 3 (vs. 2 target) molecular leads, which progressed to in vivo studies, 1 (vs. 1 target) new target for Parkinson's disease, and 10 (vs. 10 target) trial design improvements.  

Strengthen foundations (ESG / Human Capital) (10%)  
- Maintained strong reputation across key external ESG indices: #1 in the 2024 Access to Medicine Index, CDP's Climate Change and Water Security â€œA Listsâ€ (only company in our peer group to achieve that score), AA ratings with MSCI.  
- Across our portfolio, our medicines reached 296 million patients in approximately 120 countries. We continued to implement a global access strategy for 100 % of new medicines launched.  
- Collaboration with The Max Foundation provided access to >100,000 patients across over 70 LMICs to key Novartis medicines such as Glivec, Tasigna, Scemblix, Kisqali and Femara.  
- Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions reduced by 15 % from a 2022 base year, keeping us on track for our 2040 net-zero target. Water consumption and waste reduced by 9 % and 17 % from the prior year, respectively.  

2024 was another strong performance exceeding external (consensus) and internal (targets) expectations. Sales, profit and free cash flow growth were strong. The focus on innovative medicines and simplification of our operations after the organizational restructuring are having a visible impact across the company."
"Our ability to maintain and grow our business and to replace revenue and income lost to generic, biosimilar and other competition depends heavily on the commercial success of our new or existing key products.  
The commercial success of these products could be impacted at any time by a number of factors, including pressure from new or existing competitive products, changes in the prescribing habits of healthcare professionals, slower than expected post-launch adoption, unexpected side effects or safety signals, supply chain issues or other product shortages, pricing pressure, regulatory proceedings, changes in labeling, loss of intellectual property protection, and global pandemics.  
In addition, our revenue and margins could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of new products.  
We operate in competitive and rapidly changing markets and could be adversely affected if we fail to keep pace with technological changes.  
Healthcare professionals, patients and payers may choose competitor products instead of ours for various reasons, including if they perceive them to be better in terms of efficacy, safety, cost, convenience or other reasons.  
The commercial success of our key products and launches in the face of increasing competition requires significant attention, management focus and resource allocation.  
Such competition could significantly affect the revenue from our products and our results of operations.  
This impact could also be compounded to the extent that such competition results in us making significant additional investments in research and development, marketing or sales.  
The continual development and usage of advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements is an important way in which we deliver our key commercial priorities and remain competitive.  
If we fail to keep pace with technological changes in our industry, including through the use of new and disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), we may experience lower revenues and lower margins.  
Furthermore, from time to time, we reassess how our business is organized to help ensure that we have the optimal structure with which to execute our strategy.  
An inability to successfully implement new organizational structures and operating models could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition."
