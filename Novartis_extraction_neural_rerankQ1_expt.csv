As part of our overall strategy, we focus on priority projects that can be scaled globally and have the highest impact. One focus area is implementing artificial intelligence (AI) use cases across our business. For example, through our strategic research collaboration with Isomorphic Labs, we have developed an AI model predicting protein folding to
reshape drug design. We are also exploring how AI can automate parts of clinical trial report writing. As part of our AI strategy, we are empowering employees to leverage AI-powered tools effectively and securely to enhance productivity and decisionmaking. In 2024, we launched an enterprise-wide AI upskilling campaign for employees, which includes supporting the adoption of Microsoft Copilot. We also established a 'Data Science Academy' for data scientists and other employees. ### Page 22 ###",21,Data science and digital technology,combined_novartis_chunk_1261,25.3608,0.0467,0.4059,0.5421,0.5012,-7.5098,-4.3163,0.1,-4.2963,0.5405,-5.4574
