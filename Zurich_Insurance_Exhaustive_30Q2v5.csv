## Methods and assumptions used in the SST sensitivity analysis
The use of SST sensitivities for assessing the nature and extent of risks arising from insurance contracts is deemed appropriate as SST represents a comprehensive framework that takes into account the interdependencies between risks and is used by the Group to assess and manage risk. The sensitivity analysis provides information on how the Group’s SST AQR and solvency ratio are affected by changes in risk variables. The SST AQR and solvency ratio sensitivities are presented before tax and net of external reinsurance. SST AQR and related sensitivities are evaluated as instantaneous market or insurance shocks. All elements of the economic balance sheet and the required capital sensitive to a market or insurance parameter shock are recalculated. For example, values of all balance sheet and risk components change when foreign exchange moves by 10 percent; however, in a shock to equity markets the FDC net insurance liabilities and risk remain constant. To assess the SST AQR and related sensitivities, SST balance sheet positions are fully revalued under the given shock scenarios. Each instrument is revalued separately, taking relevant product features into account. Non-linear valuation effects, where they exist, are reflected in the calculations. Valuation of the insurance liabilities under the shock scenarios is based on the replicating portfolio representing the insurance liabilities in the SST Market Risk model.",230,"January 1, 2023",zurich_insurance_ocr_pages_p230_chunk_0002,8.531178856998139,0.03395726027812402,0.5119932225233603,0.48972153663635254,0.49640304240245486,0.4,0.1596669912338257,0.0825434446334839,0.12881757259368898,0.9479300714399306,0.0,0.9479300714399306

The remuneration system and practices are embedded in the Group’s Enterprise Risk Management framework and comply with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as market developments. ### Guiding principles of the remuneration philosophy
The guiding principles of the remuneration philosophy, aligned to Zurich’s remuneration rules, are as follows:
- The remuneration architecture is simple, transparent, applied effectively and considers the interests of key stakeholders such as customers, shareholders and employees.
- Reward decisions are made on the basis of merit – performance, skills, experience, qualifications and potential – and are free from discrimination toward or against particular diverse backgrounds. These principles ensure all employees have equal opportunities. - The structure and level of total remuneration are aligned with the Group’s risk policies and risk appetite.",83,Philosophy,zurich_insurance_ocr_pages_p83_chunk_0001,7.879809901679251,0.05342880244478166,0.5241220299588905,0.5358390808105469,0.5323239655550499,0.30000000000000004,0.1590032458305359,0.0,0.09540194749832154,0.8704847445543785,0.0,0.8704847445543785

Costs incurred during the development phase are capitalised. Software under development is tested for impairment annually. Acquired software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring the specific software into use. The useful lives of software licenses and capitalised internal software development costs generally range from three to five years. In limited circumstances, capitalised software development costs may be amortised over a period of up to 10 years, taking into account the effects of obsolescence, technology, competition and other economic and legal factors.

### Share-based compensation and cash incentive plans
The Group operates long-term incentive plans that are accounted for as equity-settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of these incentive plans is determined at the grant date, taking into consideration non-vesting and non-market conditions. The Group’s long-term incentive plan (LTIP) is based on the Group’s total shareholder return (TSR) measured against an international peer group of insurance companies. The Group’s LTIP is included in the performance metrics. Subsequently, the Group may revise its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to be issued based on the expected fulfilment of the service and non-market conditions. Under the Group’s LTIP, the non-market conditions, such as the average business operating profit after tax attributable to shareholders return on common shareholders’ equity (ROPAE), the cumulative net cash remittances, as well as operational CO2e emissions reduction targets which is newly included in the performance metrics. The impact of the revision, if any, is recognised in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital.",304,Software,zurich_insurance_ocr_pages_p304_chunk_0001,6.409011529384628,0.03348406194639556,0.4031432687933537,0.543946385383606,0.5017054504065303,0.30000000000000004,0.1843757748603821,0.07095266977945963,0.13900653282801312,0.8573080635377356,0.0,0.8573080635377356

The employer’s contributions typically range from 2 percent to 13 percent of annual pensionable salary, depending on a number of factors. The Group’s contributions under these plans amounted to USD 297 million and USD 301 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. ### b) Defined benefit pension plans
The largest defined benefit obligations are in the pension plans in Switzerland, the UK, the U.S. and Germany, which together comprise over 90 percent of the Group’s total defined benefit obligation. The remaining plans in other countries are not individually significant, therefore, no separate disclosure is provided. Certain Group companies provide defined benefit pension plans, some of which provide benefits on retirement, death or disability related to employees’ service periods and pensionable earnings. Others provide cash balance plans where the employee’s benefit is based on the sum of employee and employer contributions (where past) together with additional cash credits in line with the rules of the plan. Most of the Group’s defined benefit pension plans are funded through contributions by the Group and, in some cases also by employees, to investment vehicles managed by trusts or foundations independent of the Group’s finances, or by management committees with fiduciary responsibilities. Where a trust or foundation exists, it is required to law or regulation to be managed by a board of trustees or directors, who are independent of the sponsoring company and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund.

The Group actively uses collateral to mitigate credit risks. Underlying credit risks are managed independently from the collateral.

Letters of credit enable Zurich to limit the risks embedded in reinsurance, captives, deductible programs, trade credit and suretys. The Group has counterparty limits which are regularly monitored.

Group aggregate concentration limits and relevant exception approaches are monitored in line with risk policy requirements. On-balance sheet exposures are the main source of credit risk. Off-balance sheet credit exposures are related primarily to certain insurance products, reinsurance and collateral used to protect underlying credit exposures on the balance sheet.

# Analysis by risk type (continued)
## Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of financial loss, adverse reputational, legal or regulatory impact, resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people, systems or from external events, including external fraud, catastrophes, or failure in outsourcing arrangements. Zurich has a framework to identify, assess, manage, monitor, and report operational risk within the Group. Within this framework, the Group:
- Uses a scenario-based approach to assess, model and quantify the capital required for operational risk for business units under extreme circumstances. This approach allows information to be compared across the Group and highlights the main scenarios contributing to the capital required under Zurich Economic Capital Model (ZECM).
- Documents and reviews operational events exceeding a threshold determined by the Zurich Risk Policy. Remedial action is taken to avoid the recurrence of such operational events.
- Conducts risk assessments where operational risks are identified for key business areas. Risks identified and assessed to be above a certain threshold must have a risk response. Risk mitigation plans are documented and tracked on an ongoing basis. In the assessments, the Group uses sources of information such as the Total Risk Profiling™ process, internal control assessments, and audit findings, as well as scenario modelling and operational event data. The Group has specific processes and systems in place to focus on high-priority operational matters such as managing information security and business resilience, as well as combating fraud. Preventing, detecting and responding to fraud are embedded in Zurich’s business processes. Both claims and non-claims fraud are included in the common framework for assessing and managing operational risk. For Zurich’s internal model calculations, claims fraud is part of insurance risk and non-claims fraud is part of operational risk.",247,Introduction,zurich_insurance_ocr_pages_p247_chunk_0000,8.688308112075163,0.042968212365067426,0.5408895257589312,0.4794643819332123,0.49789192508092794,0.30000000000000004,0.0,0.2800362229347229,0.11201448917388918,0.8426977207504837,0.49258023500442505,1.2577939620754504

# 1. Introduction (continued)
## Selected 2023 sustainability highlights (continued) ### Including non-financial targets in Executive incentive plans
Entering our new 2023-2025 financial cycle, our long-term incentive plan (LTIP) includes, besides other factors, operational CO2e emissions showing the importance which we place on non-financial targets. ### Achieving recognition with Supply Chain Engagement Leader status
Our engagement towards sustainability within the supply chain has been recognized as we were one of only five insurance companies to be recognized with Supply Chain Engagement Leader status by CDP.2
CDP recognizes us among the top 8 percent of companies for supplier engagement on climate change. ### Providing new opportunities to our people
Our focus on providing new opportunities and development areas for our people is part of prioritizing internal hires. For example, Zurich Santander3 launched a new Talent Acquisition Hub in 2023. The Hub focuses on making it easier for employees to move to new roles internally as part of their personal development and growth ambitions. This is possible thanks to a continuous effort in communication, both from our internal channels like intranet, mailbox and periodic talent newsletter, but also through communication between HR teams and managers. ### Broadening the support to our customers
During 2023 we increased the number of hubs authorized to write renewable energy from four to ten. Each hub supports renewable energy customers based on local market requirements and bundles the required underwriting expertise. To broaden the support we can provide to our customers, we also introduced a new offshore wind proposition. We continue to upskill and cross train underwriters and recruit additional expertise as needed, including a green graduate program to further build our talent pipeline. 1.

Underwriters are required to perform sustainability assessments where customers are identified as having a high risk of violating one of Zurich’s policies, based on company level third-party information and guidance on sensitive industry and country combinations where third-party information is not available. While these inputs provide the first materiality assessments, decisions on how to proceed with a customer rely on individual assessments by the relevant underwriters, with support from the global Underwriting sustainability desk, if required. These assessments leverage both customer information, such as sustainability reports and policies, as well as external media reporting on negative environmental and human rights-related impacts associated with the customer. Based on the assessment outcome, the customer will either be cleared for business, restricted for business, or if more information is needed, temporarily cleared under the condition of ongoing engagement. Assessment customers are recorded in Zurich’s Customer Relationship Management tool to make those decisions available for other underwriters within Zurich working on the same customer. Sustainability assessments depend on the customer’s disclosure of issues or on coverage of sustainability issues through media reporting. New sustainability issues and new relevant information can emerge over time.",131,Figure 6,zurich_insurance_ocr_pages_p131_chunk_0001,5.325885327955778,0.018752581761595697,0.31395042699037423,0.565620481967926,0.49011946547466045,0.30000000000000004,0.1518130421638489,0.0803174442715115,0.12321480300691393,0.839405386677426,0.0,0.839405386677426

The Group’s consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses and cash flows of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity that Zurich Insurance Group Ltd either directly or indirectly controls. Generally, control is achieved by holding the majority of the voting rights which allows the Group to control relevant activities of the subsidiary. The Group may hold significant interests in investment entities, where the voting rights are not the dominant factor of control. To the extent the Group is involved in the design and has significant exposure to the risks and variable returns from such investment entities, the Group is deemed to have control and consolidates such investment entities. The results of subsidiaries acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results of subsidiaries that have been divested during the year are included up to the date control ceased. All intra-Group balances, profits and transactions are eliminated. Changes in ownership interests in a subsidiary that do not result in a change in control are recorded within equity. Non-controlling interests are shown separately in equity, consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of changes in equity. The consolidated financial statements are prepared as of December 31 based on individual company financial statements at the same date. In some cases, information is included with a time lag of up to three months. The impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements is not material. ### Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The review also confirmed that the Group's U.S. operating companies were not involved in or connected to those activities.

# Message from our Group Chief Risk Officer
> Proactive risk management has been central in enabling the Group to become accustomed to operating in today’s highly uncertain and volatile environment.
## Successful risk management in uncertain times
![Image of a man in a suit](image_url)
**Dear Shareholder**
The uncertainty of recent years persisted in 2023, with the year dominated by a continued rise in geopolitical tensions and the ongoing challenge of bringing inflation under control in major economies.
The Group has become accustomed to operating within this volatile and uncertain external environment as it continued to deliver a robust financial performance, finishing financially robust in 2023. Managing risks has been at the center of this success, enabling the Group to adapt quickly to identify, assess and manage the threats arising from today’s uncertain and rapidly changing world.
This foundational role has been attained by firstly providing all our employees with the right tools and training to continuously monitor risks within the Group’s operations, and secondly embedding a culture, driven by a deep understanding of risks, where risk-reward trade-offs are transparent, understood and appropriately managed.

## 19. Employee benefits
The Group operates a number of retirement benefit arrangements for employees. Historically, the majority of employees belonged to defined benefit pension plans and some will still have past service benefits accrued in those plans. However, the majority of employees now accrue benefits under defined contribution plans, which provide benefits equal to the amounts contributed by both the employer and the employee plus investment returns. Certain of the Group’s operating companies also provide post-employment benefit plans covering medical care and life insurance, mainly in the U.S. Eligibility for these plans is generally based on completion of a specified period of eligible service and reaching a specified age. The plans typically pay a stated percentage of medical expenses subject to deductibles and other factors. The cost of post-employment benefits is accrued during the employees’ service periods. The Group Pensions Committee is responsible for developing, reviewing and advising on the Group governance framework in matters related to pension and post-employment benefit arrangements.

This is reflected in our internal hire rate of 84.3 percent for the senior management population. External hires at this level aim to bring in people with critical skills and are an opportunity to increase the diversity of our employee population globally. As an example, to support long-term employability, Zurich Santander launched a new Talent Attraction Hub in 2023 to attract new talent and encourage talents to reach for growth within the company. The Business is committed to publishing all positions across the Zurich Santander organization, and prioritizing internal candidates.
