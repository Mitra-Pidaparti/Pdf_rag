Aligned with market practice in Switzerland, the Board 
of Directors sets compensation for its members at a level 
that allows for the attraction of high-caliber individuals, 
including both Swiss and international members, who 
have global experience. Given their focus on corporate strategy, supervision 
and governance, Board members do not receive variable 
compensation. Each year at the AGM, shareholders are 
requested to approve, in a binding vote, the total com-
pensation of the Board of Directors until the following 
AGM. The Board of Directors sets the level of compensa-
tion for its Chair and other members to be in line with

Risk management
Our approach
Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
framework is designed to generate a 
holistic view of risks for our company and 
drive a culture of informed risk-taking that 
advances our strategy. Our annual ERM process is based on three 
main steps: understanding and adapting to 
the rapidly changing dynamics of our 
external environment; identifying, 
assessing and analyzing potential risks to 
the success of our strategy; and setting a 
clear risk appetite for each risk and taking 
actions to achieve our target risk exposure. Throughout the year, we hold risk 
workshops with business leaders from 
countries, organizational units and global 
functions. This helps us integrate risk 
management into our activities and better 
understand our risk exposure through

Sustainability matters
Corporate governance, risk 
management and compensation
Our environmental sustainability strategy 
has three priorities:
•	 Planet: Achieve climate and nature 
targets, including net-zero greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions by 2040
•	 Patients: Develop sustainable products 
for patients, applying sustainable 
design principles for new products
•	 People and policy: Transform the 
sustainability mindset across our 
organization and collaborate with 
industry partners to influence change in 
our sector
Oversight of our environmental 
sustainability strategy, including climate 
and nature topics, ultimately lies with our 
Board of Directors. The Board has delegated 
certain duties and responsibilities to some 
of its committees, who report back to the 
full Board on their activities and findings. At management level, the Chief Executive

Context and potential impact We are heavily dependent on critical, complex and inter‑
dependent information technology (IT) systems, includ‑
ing internet‑based systems to support our business pro‑
cesses. We also outsource significant parts of our IT 
infrastructure to third-party providers, including those 
who provide AI services and technology, and currently 
use these providers to perform business-critical IT ser‑
vices for us. We are therefore vulnerable to cybersecu‑
rity attacks and incidents on such networks and systems,

the uninterrupted and timely supply of

by administrative procedures (e.g., 
business continuity plans). Further, we 
have an active energy management 
system to optimize energy consumption

geographic footprint, dual supply for key 
products, and inventory level and stock

pronounced in Asia, Africa and Australasia, 
with a potential increase in sales of 2.7% 
to 2.8% per USD million in sales by 2050. Climate-related events can also threaten 
the uninterrupted and timely supply of 
medicines that meet all product 
specifications and quality standards. We have established policies and 
processes to support the quality and 
resilience of our supply chain and 
manufacturing processes. For instance, 
we have mitigated physical risks to our 
sites by putting in place infrastructure 
(e.g., shelters, flood defenses), supported 
by administrative procedures (e.g., 
business continuity plans). Further, we 
have an active energy management 
system to optimize energy consumption 
based on site-specific requirements. As for our supply chain, its broad 
geographic footprint, dual supply for key 
products, and inventory level and stock 
policies make it resilient. In addition,

digital field-testing solutions, including a 
mobile app (MoVe) for packaging 
verification and a hand-held testing device 
(Authentifield) for product authentication. We also use intelligence tools and have 
equipped most impacted markets with 
toolkits to help them develop capabilities 
to mitigate the risks of illegal diversion. Further, we have strengthened our supply 
chain security capabilities and governance 
to improve our ability to mitigate incidents 
of product theft in high-risk regions. Overall, we continuously work with public 
and private stakeholders to encourage 
coordinated action on falsified medicines 
and protect patients’ safety. Main activities in 2024

Novartis in Society  
Integrated Report 2024
In our first full-year as a pure-play 
medicines company, Novartis delivered 
strong results, with double-digit growth 
in sales and net profit in 2024. The 
performance validates our strategy 
and gives us confidence that we are 
well prepared to grow by focusing 
on our key therapeutic areas and 
technology platforms. The strategic shift from a diversified life 
sciences company to a focused medicines 
organization over the last decade has 
proven to be the right path forward. With 
the divestment of our non-core activities 
in animal health, vaccines and generics, 
among others, we were able to free up 
resources and strengthen our position in 
fast-growing and highly innovative medical 
fields such as xRNA, radioligand therapy 
and gene and cell therapy. Our recent breakthroughs in breast 
cancer and kidney and blood diseases 
demonstrate that our operational focus 
strengthens our ability to deliver high-value 
medicines that allevia",4,,page4_chunk000,28.3258,0.0283,0.4008,0.4792,0.4557,-11.1862,-6.5357,0.1,-6.5157,0.0,-6.5157

Our approach
Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
framework is designed to generate a 
holistic view of risks for our company and 
drive a culture of informed risk-taking that 
advances our strategy. Our annual ERM process is based on three 
main steps: understanding and adapting to 
the rapidly changing dynamics of our 
external environment; identifying, 
assessing and analyzing potential risks to 
the success of our strategy; and setting a 
clear risk appetite for each risk and taking 
actions to achieve our target risk exposure. Throughout the year, we hold risk 
workshops with business leaders from 
countries, organizational units and global 
functions. This helps us integrate risk 
management into our activities and better 
understand our risk exposure through

Credit risk
Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may 
not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To man-
age this risk, the Company periodically assesses coun-
try and customer credit risk, assigns individual credit lim-
its, and takes actions to mitigate credit risk where 
appropriate (for example payment guarantees, credit 
insurance and factoring). The provisions for expected credit losses for cus-
tomers are based on a forward-looking expected credit 
loss, which includes possible default events on the trade 
receivables over the entire holding period of the trade 
receivables. In measuring the expected credit losses, trade receiv-
ables are grouped based on shared credit risk charac-

Impact and risk management
Animal research is a necessary element in 
the development of new treatments in 
pre-clinical research to ensure the safety 
of clinical trials. The use of animals in 
research carries the risk of causing 
physical and psychological harm, including 
pain, stress, or suffering, to the animals 
involved. Failure to uphold high welfare 
standards can result in ethical concerns 
and undermine public trust. Main policies
We fully support the replacement of 
animals with alternatives wherever 
feasible, while meeting our obligations to 
patients and the expectations of 
regulatory agencies. Our animal research is governed by our 
Animal Welfare policy, which applies to all 
Novartis-sponsored studies, whether 
internal or external. The policy commits us 
to applying the 3Rs principles — to replace 
animals with other method",45,,page45_chunk001,23.305,0.0304,0.3918,0.447,0.4305,-10.7941,-6.3087,0.2,-6.2687,0.4799,-6.8704

remained stable and fell slightly for 
third-party personnel, reflecting the 
continued reinforcement of our internal 
HSE Management system at site level. In 
2024, the implementation of the HSE 
system was reviewed via our internal 
controls process and this assessment 
covered more than 99% of Novartis 
employees. Human rights

among the core enterprise risks evaluated through our 
annual enterprise risk management assessment. The Chief Security Officer oversees our cybersecu-
