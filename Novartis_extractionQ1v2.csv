Once key risks were identified, mitigation action plans were created to address them in an effective way.  

The findings from these workshops were consolidated into the Novartis Risk Radar, which enables senior management, the Executive Committee and the Board to focus discussions on key risks and more closely align our corporate strategy with our risk exposure and ways of working.  

In 2024, the Corporate ERC team further developed the ERM framework within the Novartis Corporate ERC organization.  

We developed additional risk management training and launched our risk intelligence forum, an event that brought together internal and external speakers to address emerging trends and threats.  

We also integrated a critical scope of activities (Trade Sanctions Governance) into the Corporate ERC team.

""We reached nearly 300 million patients with our innovative therapies — more than ever before. ""
Looking ahead, I'm confident we'll see sales growth average at least 5% annually over the five years to 2029, and reach 40% core operating income margin by 2027! We're proud of our record and excited about the future. I want to offer a special note of thanks to outgoing Board Chair Joerg Reinhardt, who steps down after decades of leadership at Novartis. His impact will carry forward, and I'm grateful for his years of mentorship. In recent years, we've narrowed our focus, expanded our reach, and invested in the future. The result is a strong portfolio of innovative therapies that sets us up for sustained growth and finds new ways to improve and extend patients' lives. Thank you for making that possible. We look forward to continuing our momentum in 2025. Sincerely,
**Vas Narasimhan**

We reached nearly 300 million patients with our innovative therapies - more than ever before - as we built on the momentum from our successful transformation. We consistently delivered strong financial and operational performance, significant R\&D achievements, and sustainable growth, and are well positioned to increase value for shareholders and society moving forward. Core to our approach is a relentless focus on innovation. It allowed us to develop and expand access to new treatments in our key therapeutic areas and technology platforms. In oncology, we built on the legacy of our work in areas like breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia with Kisqali and Scemblix, medicines developed by researchers in Novartis labs - a testament to the strength of our R\&D engine. We secured our spot as a global leader in radioligand therapy (RLT), a platform we believe has the potential to transform cancer care. Pluvicto, our RLT therapy for advanced prostate cancer, showed strength in the US and Europe. We are exploring new referral pathways and investing in RLT manufacturing to broaden its global availability. Our investments in cutting edge technology fueled innovation across therapeutic areas. We continue to prioritize platforms like RLT and RNA therapeutics, and increasingly integrate artificial intelligence and data science throughout our R\&D activities. These tools are helping uncover potential ways to accelerate drug design and clinical trial processes. Through a combination of in-house R\&D and targeted acquisitions and licensing agreements, we now have more than 30 potential new high-value medicines in our pipeline and expect more than 15 submission-enabling readouts over the next two years. We remain committed to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. We rank highly among industry peers in a range of key ESG ratings, and were honored to rank number one in the 2024 Access to Medicine Index. Fostering a culture of innovation depends on people. We aim to recruit, retain, and cultivate the best talent in the world.

- A data in scope for external limited assurance
- ^{1} Excluding cell, gene, and radioligand therapies (RLT) These systemic barriers also extend to the complex process of registering and distributing medicines globally. To bring a pharmaceutical product to market, a registration dossier containing evidence of the product's safety, efficacy, and quality must be submitted to regulatory authorities. Depending on the country, this process can take months or even years, influenced by the efficiency of the regulatory body and nature of the product. Furthermore, the negotiation of selling prices or reimbursement levels with regulators and payers often delays availability, while cost-containment measures — such as government-imposed price reductions and reference pricing systems — can further limit access to medicines. Failure to tackle these challenges collectively risks not only delaying access to medicines for patients but also impacting public trust, reputation, and business sustainability.

This focus enables us to build depth in these therapeutic areas, leveraging our scientific expertise to find new ways to treat and cure disease, intervene earlier in disease pathophysiology, and improve quality of life for patients.  
We focus our exploratory research work in these core therapeutic areas, but also look beyond them, recognizing that cultivating a robust pipeline and remaining on the leading edge of scientific discovery requires a slightly wider aperture in early research.  
We are investing in technology platforms that we expect will deliver future high-value medicines.  
We focus on two established platforms (chemistry and biotherapeutics) plus three advanced platforms (radioligand therapy (RLT), xRNA, and gene and cell therapy) that will play an important role in delivering transformative new medicines.  
We focus on priority markets-US, Germany, China and Japan-which together account for most of the expected growth in global healthcare spending over the next five years.  
Although these are our priority markets, we maintain a strong presence in other markets worldwide.  

To support our focus areas, we have three strategic priorities:  
- Deliver high-value medicines to accelerate growth.  
- We aim to increase growth, driven by continued strong momentum in our existing portfolio of medicines including Entresto, Cosentyx, Kisqali, Kesimpta, Scemblix, Pluvicto and Leqvio and key upcoming launches.  
- Over the longer term, we expect growth will come through delivering high-value medicines that sustain and replace our existing growth drivers.  
- Our R&D strategy focuses on an end-to-end approach, covering research, development and commercialization.  
- We concentrate resources on priority programs to maximize early-stage potential and ensure effective late-stage execution.  
- We also focus on life-cycle management by enhancing the evidence base for key brands.  
- We increase our chances of discovering new medicines by collaborating with outside researchers and biotech companies.  
- Our network consists of academic and industry alliances working on joint research and drug discovery.  

Embed operational excellence to deliver returns.  
In an increasingly competitive environment, we are simplifying processes and reducing costs to become more efficient and effective in our decision-making and to free up resources for investment in new medicines.

that Novartis has a Board that is performing well and improving, where Directors are highly engaged and have a good rapport, and where there is effective succession and rejuvenation in place. Feedback from management on the Board's evaluation showed that the Executive Committee welcomes the interactions with the Board and its members, as well as the balanced supportive/ challenging dynamics and rich discussions. The report made several recommendations for the Board's consideration, including preparing for the transition to a new Board Chair in 2025 and areas where the Board should focus its attention in the future.

## Summary of the Work we Performed as the Basis for our Assurance Conclusion
We are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas where we have identified that a material misstatement of the Sustainability Information is likely to arise. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. Carrying out our limited assurance engagement on the Sustainability Information included, among others:
- Inquiries of employees responsible for the determination and consolidation as well as the implementation of internal control procedures regarding the Sustainability Information;
- Inspection of selected internal and external documents to determine whether qualitative and quantitative information is supported by sufficient evidence and presented in an accurate and balanced manner;
- Assessment of the data collection, validation and reporting processes as well as the reliability of the reported data on a test basis and through testing of selected calculations;
- Analytical assessment of the data and trends of the Sustainability Information included in the scope of the limited assurance engagement;
- Considering the appropriateness of the carbon conversion factor calculations and other unit conversion factor calculations used by reference to widely recognised and established conversion factors;
- Reading the narrative within the Report with regards to the Reporting Criteria, and for consistency with our findings; and
- Evaluating whether Novartis's methods for developing key estimates were appropriate and had been consistently applied.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement.",73,Our Independence and Quality Control,combined_novartis_chunk_1061,17.1022,0.0227,0.2534,0.3197,0.5767,0.4607,0.1,0.2197,0.1107,0.1761,0.2534,0.7148,0.5826,0.2536,1.4182
