Our annual ERM process is based on three main steps: understanding and adapting to the rapidly changing dynamics of our external environment; identifying, assessing and analyzing potential risks to the success of our strategy; and setting a clear risk appetite for each risk and taking actions to achieve our target risk exposure.
Throughout the year, we hold risk workshops with business leaders from countries, organizational units and global functions. This helps us integrate risk management into our activities and better understand our risk exposure through transparency on how key risks and opportunities are evolving.
Risk exposure is rated on a four-point scale - very high, high, medium, and low - based on likelihood and potential impact, using the 'most-probable worst-case' scenarios for each risk as reference points. We create mitigation plans and monitor each risk to achieve our target risk exposure.
Overall, our 2024 risk portfolio was similar to 2023. We continued to take mitigation measures to reduce our net risk exposure while updating our ERM framework and risk definitions to reflect changes in our strategic priorities and business environment taking into account risk amplifiers such as geostrategy, technology acceleration, climate change and evolving societal expectations.",53,Our approach,combined_novartis_chunk_1008,25.1509,0.0255,0.4447,0.5337,0.507,-9.5771,-5.5506,0.2,-5.5106,0.0,-5.5106

- ^{1} Excluding cell, gene, and radioligand therapies (RLT) These systemic barriers also extend to the complex process of registering and distributing medicines globally. To bring a pharmaceutical product to market, a registration dossier containing evidence of the product's safety, efficacy, and quality must be submitted to regulatory authorities. Depending on the country, this process can take months or even years, influenced by the efficiency of the regulatory body and nature of the product. Furthermore, the negotiation of selling prices or reimbursement levels with regulators and payers often delays availability, while cost-containment measures — such as government-imposed price reductions and reference pricing systems — can further limit access to medicines. Failure to tackle these challenges collectively risks not only delaying access to medicines for patients but also impacting public trust, reputation, and business sustainability. Therefore, a holistic effort — focused on patient-centered solutions, regulatory innovation, and shared accountability — is essential to bridging the gap between innovation and accessibility. |  Access to medicines performance indicators | 2024 | 2023 | 2022  |

Healthcare systems, healthcare providers and patients rely on us to meet the highest quality standards. Regardless of whether our products and the related raw materials are developed and manufactured at our own manufacturing sites or by third parties, we must ensure that all development, manufacturing, quality and supply processes comply with regulatory requirements, as well as our own quality standards in order to deliver novel therapies while ensuring patient safety. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of products, injunctions, product recalls, failure to secure product approvals, debarment, or harm to patients or our reputation.
In recent years, global health authorities have substantially intensified their scrutiny of manufacturers' compliance with regulatory requirements. Any significant failure by us or our third-party suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements, or with health authorities' expectations, may create the need to suspend clinical trials, suspend manufacturing, shut down production facilities or production lines, and recall clinical or commercial products. Additionally, we may acquire new companies or technology platforms that may not fully comply with regulatory requirements or expectations, which may pose legal, financial and reputation risks for us post-acquisition. A failure to fully comply with regulatory requirements could also lead to a delay in the approval of new products, an inability to ship or import our products, and significant penalties and reputational harm.
In addition, the technically complex manufacturing processes required to manufacture many of our products increase the risk of both production failures and product recalls, and can increase the cost of producing our goods. Some of our products require a supply of highly specialized raw materials, such as cell lines, tissue samples, bacteria, viral strains and radioisotopes. In addition, we manufacture and sell a number of sterile products, biologic products and products that involve advanced therapy platforms, such as gene and cell therapy, radioligand therapy, and xRNA, all of which are particularly complex and involve highly specialized manufacturing technologies. For more information, see ""Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B. Business over-view-Production."" As a result, even slight deviations at any point in their production processes or in the materials used have led to, and may in the future lead to, production failures or recalls.

We have dedicated teams that actively seek to optimize patient access, including formulary positions, for our products. The trend toward consolidation among distributors and retailers of our products continues in the US and internationally, both within and across countries. This has increased our customers' purchasing leverage and resulted in increased pricing pressure on our products. Moreover, we are exposed to increased concentration of credit risk as a result of the consolidation among our customers. Drug pricing is an increasingly prominent issue in many countries as healthcare spending continues to rise. This issue has received significant attention in the US, especially with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (see ""-Price controls"" for more information).

Our access policies are designed to ensure we do our part to address affordability, availability, and equity in healthcare, while recognizing that meaningful progress requires collaboration across the entire healthcare ecosystem. Our commitment is guided by the belief that innovative medicines and healthcare solutions should be available to all who need them, regardless of geographic or economic barriers. To achieve this, we integrate access considerations into the various stages of our work, from research and development to distribution and pricing strategies. ### **Research and development**
We systematically assess our R&D portfolio against unmet medical needs, integrating access considerations early in the development process. By the end of Phase II, we anticipate potential access barriers and enablers to ensure our investigational medicines have the potential to reach patients that could benefit the most. Diverse patient representation in clinical trials is critical to our R&D efforts. Understanding how patients from different demographic groups respond to treatment is essential to developing effective and inclusive medicines. To this end, we incorporate diversity principles into all Phase III studies with US participation, aligning with FDA guidance. Our teams establish enrollment goals based on disease prevalence and demographic factors such as race, ethnicity, sex, and age to recruit a representative US population. Additionally, we provide training for employees in R&D to ensure the inclusion of underrepresented populations in clinical trials, reinforcing our commitment to developing medicines that serve the broadest range of patients worldwide. ### **Access strategy for new product launches**
For each new product launch, we work to address non-clinical barriers that may hinder adoption and uptake. By

collaborating with governments and healthcare systems, we develop innovative pricing and access solutions tailored to the needs of individual markets. While we aim to make our products available globally, we recognize that access may vary by country. Factors such as regulatory requirements, healthcare infrastructure, and pricing frameworks can affect availability. In some cases, a product may be sold under a different brand name or be indicated for specific uses based on the needs and policies of a given country.",39,Falsified medicines,combined_novartis_chunk_0974,22.094,0.0319,0.4311,0.5011,0.4801,-10.7836,-6.2837,0.1,-6.2637,0.0,-6.2637

|  Research and development (R\&D) | R\&D is vital to our strategy. Our ability to grow our business and advance our product pipeline depends in significant part on the success of our R\&D efforts. We may be unable to develop the necessary clinical evidence to achieve the full potential of our assets. In addition, failure to successfully implement new technologies such as Al may put us at a competitive disadvantage and impact our productivity and pipeline value. | We are focusing our efforts on core therapeutic areas and shifting more of our portfolio to new technology platforms such as cell and gene therapy, radioligand therapy, and xRNA. To do this, we need to have clear strategic objectives, be efficient and set clear priorities, with a focus on projects that have the highest potential. We also have a clear Al strategy and are investing in the enabling infrastructure, capabilities, and external partnerships needed to scale our most promising Al use cases across the R\&D continuum. |
|  Environmental, social and governance matters | Increasingly, companies are being judged by their performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. Topics related to large societal changes such as climate change are increasingly important to a wide range of our stakeholders. Failing to meet our ESG commitments could adversely affect our reputation, recruitment, retention, operations, financial performance, and share price. | Building trust with society is part of our corporate strategy. We have developed an ESG strategic roadmap with clear targets on material ESG topics. We are also taking steps to further strengthen our approach to external partner ESG risk. We monitor changes to ESG regulations, particularly regarding new reporting and due diligence requirements. In addition, we have policies, controls and internal programs to ensure ESG is embedded in our decision-making. |

""Additionally, if we are unable to manage our external workforce effectively it could lead to suboptimal access to external capabilities, limited cost management, reduced engagement, increased IT and compliance risks, and impaired strategic decision-making.""","We rely on identifying, attracting, developing and retaining a diverse, highly skilled workforce across our business and functions to achieve our objectives. If we are unable to sustain our supply of key personnel-including senior members of our scientific and management teams, high-quality researchers and development specialists and skilled employees with key capabilities in key markets-our ability to achieve our major business objectives may be adversely affected. In addition, our brand and reputation could be negatively impacted. The market for skilled talent has become increasingly competitive, and we anticipate this trend will persist in the long term. We face a challenge to attract and retain top talent in several areas, including biology, immunology, chemistry, clinical development, drug manufacturing, data, digital and IT, oncology, and advanced therapy platforms (i.e., gene and cell therapy, radioligand therapy and xRNA) and to maintain and strengthen our employer reputation. In addition, many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and research centers, and government entities with significant capital are not only competing with us to attract the same skilled talent but are also aggressively pursuing our experienced talent. Additionally, if the performance of our leadership and management fail to build upon our capabilities, the results could be suboptimal performance of our teams and misalignment with strategic goals, and could hinder our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified talent in critical roles. Furthermore, if we are unable to retain and engage key talent of companies that we acquire and integrate, we may not be able to realize the full value of these acquisitions. In recent years, we have adopted new ways of working that include location flexibility and increasingly recruiting from a global pool of talent. However, the success of our business continues to depend on having employees who possess local knowledge of, and experience in, our key markets. The external talent supply is especially limited in many of the geographies that are expected to be sources of growth for us. In the US, China and several other markets, the geographic mobility of talent is decreasing, as they find ample career opportunities available closer to home.

The performance validates our strategy and gives us confidence that we are well prepared to grow by focusing on our key therapeutic areas and technology platforms. The strategic shift from a diversified life sciences company to a focused medicines organization over the last decade has proven to be the right path forward. With the divestment of our non-core activities in animal health, vaccines, and generics, among others, we were able to free up resources and strengthen our position in fast-growing and highly innovative medical fields such as xRNA, radioligand therapy, and gene and cell therapy. Our recent breakthroughs in breast cancer and kidney and blood diseases demonstrate that our operational focus strengthens our ability to deliver high-value medicines that alleviate society's greatest disease burdens. As we continue to accelerate our research and development efforts and strengthen our commercial capabilities, we expect to continue to grow profitably in the long-term and create sustainable shareholder value. Our efforts to more efficiently align our Research, Development, and Commercial organizations advanced further. Besides strategic acquisitions to increase our technological capacity and broaden our pipeline, we integrated artificial intelligence more deeply into our day-to-day operations to more efficiently assess new molecules and accelerate drug development timelines. In view of continuing geopolitical and economic volatility, we are further strengthening our global production and distribution network to withstand potential supply chain disruptions and improve overall resilience. We will stay disciplined in managing our technical and data infrastructure as well as our partner networks and build an agile footprint to quickly adapt to the changing environment. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters remained high on our agenda. We deepened our commitment to vital topics: improving access to medicines, taking further measures in our fight against climate change, and strengthening our ethics framework, among other things. Our efforts have been recognized by leading independent agencies and are reflected in consistently high rankings.

regard to gender, race, ethnicity, or any other protected characteristics, as defined by applicable local laws. Novartis, as a global company, complies with the laws of each country within which it operates.
Gender balance, which seeks to provide equal opportunities to both men and women and is a key element of our strategy for eliminating the gender pay gap globally, is an important part of our people strategy. This is exemplified by the commitments we made with the Equal Pay International Coalition (EPIC) in 2018 to help close the gender pay gap. These commitments included monitoring pay, excluding historical salary data from our recruitment processes, creating pay transparency, and achieving gender balance in management.
To sustain our progress, we renewed our EPIC pledge in 2023 with aspirational goals for 2027. These are: to maintain gender-balanced representation in management; to review our human resources practices beyond base pay to eliminate any further potential sources of bias from the system; and to make the requirements of the new EU Pay Transparency Directive our global minimum standard for pay equity and pay transparency reporting.
Novartis is a member of the International Labour Organization Global Business and Disability Network and the Valuable 500, promoting inclusion for people with disabilities in the workplace. We also collaborate with international partners, such as Disability:IN, Purple Space and Business Disability Forum, to identify and develop best practice solutions to enable people with disabilities to participate as equal members of our organization. Examples of this work include increasing physical and digital accessibility while integrating disability perspectives in relevant standards and practices.
In accordance with the UN Standards of Conduct for Business, we also strive to tackle discrimination against employees who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI).

Additionally, strategic deals with new technology platforms and ear-ly-stage companies contribute to our innovation. For example, in 2024, we closed the acquisitions of MorphoSys AG, Mariana Oncology and Kate Therapeutics, and entered into several strategic partnerships for the development and commercialization of innovative products across our core therapeutic areas. This strategy relies on our ability to identify strategic external business opportunities, which may be limited, including assessing the value of early-stage companies ahead of competition, and to close transactions with third parties on mutually acceptable terms. The market for clinical-stage assets and cutting-edge technology platforms within our core therapeutic areas is highly competitive and we may be unsuccessful in acquiring businesses or assets or entering into strategic partnerships that may complement our existing portfolio. Once the key terms of a strategic transaction have been agreed with a third party, we may not be able to complete the transaction as the result of, among other things, disagreement on the contractual terms or negative due diligence results. In addition, we cannot be sure that pre-transaction due diligence will identify all
possible issues that might arise during and after the transaction. Our efforts on such transactions can also divert management's attention from our existing businesses and pursuing multiple transactions at the same time may impact our ability to efficiently conduct appropriate levels of pre-transaction technical due diligence, and to consummate such transactions. After a transaction is closed, efforts to develop and commercialize acquired or licensed products, to integrate the acquired business or to achieve expected synergies may fail or may not fully meet expectations. This may occur due to difficulties in retaining key personnel, customers and suppliers; failure to obtain marketing approval or reimbursement within expected timeframes or at all; differences in corporate culture, standards, controls, processes and policies; or other factors. Transactions can also result in liabilities being incurred that were not known at the time of acquisition, or the creation of tax or accounting issues.

We reach healthcare professionals and patients in many markets and across our core therapeutic areas through integrated channels including field force operations, patient support programs and Novartis-owned digital platforms.

Novartis is responding by adapting our business practices to engage appropriately with patients, customer groups and other stakeholders, including by delivering innovative solutions to drive education, access and improved patient care. The growing number of so-called ""specialty"" drugs in our portfolio, such as Cosentyx and Kesimpta, has resulted in increased engagement with specialty pharmacies. Because many of these drugs require special handling and administration, we are rolling out patient support programs across our priority markets that serve as a central resource for onboarding, education and support to help patients navigate their healthcare. In the US, the US Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services (CMS) is the largest single payer for healthcare services as a result of continuing changes in healthcare economics and an aging population. In addition, both commercial and government-sponsored managed care organizations continue to be among the largest groups of payers for healthcare services in the US. In other countries, national health services are often the only significant payer for healthcare services.

We reached nearly 300 million patients with our innovative therapies - more than ever before - as we built on the momentum from our successful transformation. We consistently delivered strong financial and operational performance, significant R\&D achievements, and sustainable growth, and are well positioned to increase value for shareholders and society moving forward. Core to our approach is a relentless focus on innovation. It allowed us to develop and expand access to new treatments in our key therapeutic areas and technology platforms. In oncology, we built on the legacy of our work in areas like breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia with Kisqali and Scemblix, medicines developed by researchers in Novartis labs - a testament to the strength of our R\&D engine. We secured our spot as a global leader in radioligand therapy (RLT), a platform we believe has the potential to transform cancer care. Pluvicto, our RLT therapy for advanced prostate cancer, showed strength in the US and Europe. We are exploring new referral pathways and investing in RLT manufacturing to broaden its global availability. Our investments in cutting edge technology fueled innovation across therapeutic areas. We continue to prioritize platforms like RLT and RNA therapeutics, and increasingly integrate artificial intelligence and data science throughout our R\&D activities. These tools are helping uncover potential ways to accelerate drug design and clinical trial processes. Through a combination of in-house R\&D and targeted acquisitions and licensing agreements, we now have more than 30 potential new high-value medicines in our pipeline and expect more than 15 submission-enabling readouts over the next two years. We remain committed to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. We rank highly among industry peers in a range of key ESG ratings, and were honored to rank number one in the 2024 Access to Medicine Index. Fostering a culture of innovation depends on people. We aim to recruit, retain, and cultivate the best talent in the world. It's why we've rebuilt our organization to meet tomorrow's global healthcare challenges through a simpler organization, targeted hiring efforts and investments in new facilities to serve patients around the world.

This unit is responsible for the discovery and first clinical evaluation of new medicines that bring value for patients and the Company. This requires hiring and retaining highly talented employees, focusing on fundamental disease mechanisms that are relevant across different disease areas, continuously improving technologies for drug discovery and potential therapies, working with patients to understand their diseases and the potential benefits of therapies, forming close alliances with clinical and commercial colleagues, and establishing strategic external alliances.
We have 5582 full-time-equivalent scientists, physicians and business professionals at Biomedical Research sites in Basel, Switzerland; Cambridge, Massachusetts; East Hanover, New Jersey; San Diego, California; and Emeryville, California. They contribute to research in our core therapeutic areas of cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases; neuroscience; oncology; and immunology, among others. Research at the Friedrich Miescher Institute focuses on basic genetic and genomic research, and our Global Health Disease Area (formerly the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases) focuses on discovering new medicines to fight tropical diseases, including malaria and cryptosporidiosis.
All drug candidates go through clinical trials to enable an early assessment of the safety and efficacy of the drug while collecting basic information on how the drug moves through the body and is tolerated, and adhering to the guidance for early clinical testing set forth by health authorities. When assessments are favorable, our Development organizational unit conducts confirmatory trials on the drug candidates to generate data that can be submitted to regulatory authorities to secure approval for patient use.

We monitor market developments that could have an adverse effect on the supply of essential materials.","Our primary goal is to ensure the uninterrupted and timely supply of medicines that meet all product specifications and quality standards, and that are produced in the most cost-effective and sustainable manner. The manufacturing of our products is highly regulated by governmental health authorities around the world, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). In addition to regulatory requirements, many of our products involve technically complex manufacturing processes or require highly specialized raw materials. We manufacture our products across the following technologies at facilities worldwide: large molecules, small molecules, cell and gene therapy, xRNA therapy and radioligand therapy (see also ""-Item 4.D Property, plants and equipment""). We are continuing to integrate ADACAP manufacturing sites into our existing manufacturing and supply structure for radioligand therapies. In addition, we generate contract manufacturing sales from chemistry, biotherapeutics, xRNA and cell and gene therapy, including fill and finish activities, which we include under ""established brands"" in our consolidated financial statements (see ""Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 4. Revenues and geographic information""). In our manufacturing network, we maintain state-of-the-art processes, with quality as a priority, and require our suppliers to adhere to the same high standards we expect from our own people and processes. These processes include chemical and biological syntheses; radioisotope handling; sterile processing, including CAR-T cell processing; gene modification and delivery; and formulation and packaging. We are constantly working to improve our existing manufacturing processes, develop new and innovative technologies, and review and adapt our manufacturing network to maintain quality in our manufacturing processes and supply of products to customers and patients. We produce raw materials for manufacturing in-house or purchase them from third-party suppliers. Where possible, we maintain multiple supply sources so that the business is not dependent on a single or limited number of suppliers. However, our ability to do so may at times be limited by regulatory or other requirements. We monitor market developments that could have an adverse effect on the supply of essential materials. Our suppliers of raw materials are required to comply with applicable regulations and Novartis quality standards. Because the manufacturing of our products is complex and highly regulated by governmental health authorities and other regulators, uninterrupted supply cannot be guaranteed. If we or our third-party suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations, then there could be a product recall or other disruption to our production activities.",32,Production,combined_novartis_chunk_0099,15.4821,0.0192,0.2884,0.4905,0.4299,-9.9817,-5.8332,0.1,-5.8132,0.5184,-7.3199
