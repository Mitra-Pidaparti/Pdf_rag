Philosophy and benchmarking
Aligned with market practice in Switzerland, the Board 
of Directors sets compensation for its members at a level 
that allows for the attraction of high-caliber individuals, 
including both Swiss and international members, who 
have global experience. Given their focus on corporate strategy, supervision 
and governance, Board members do not receive variable 
compensation. Each year at the AGM, shareholders are 
requested to approve, in a binding vote, the total com-
pensation of the Board of Directors until the following 
AGM. The Board of Directors sets the level of compensa-
tion for its Chair and other members to be in line with 
relevant benchmark companies, including other large 
Switzerland-based multinational companies such as 
ABB, Holcim, Nestlé, Richemont, Roche, Swiss Re, UBS 
and Zurich Insurance. This peer group, which remains

equal opportunities to both men and
