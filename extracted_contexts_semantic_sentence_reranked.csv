Impact on: . Oil to Chemicals \& Retail business

## Risk Description

The Russia Ukraine conflict and consequent US and EU sanctions on Russian crude oil, product and natural gas exports have the potential for creating shortages of crude oil and products and driving up prices. This can impact the availability of crude oil and cause a spike in price of feedstock. The high energy inflation could lead to headwinds for the global economy affecting oil demand and refining margins. There was unforeseen market scenario with a disruption of energy sources and oil supply mainly in the western regions due to geo-political developments between neighbouring countries of Ukraine and Russia. This has resulted in a shift in sourcing of energy and oil from alternate destinations, which has led to change in the trade-flows worldwide. The resultant longer sea passage has created shortage of availability of tankers and thus historically high volatility in freight rates. Further, the phased embargoes of Russian products that has come into place has created challenges which are likely to continue to be more complex for transportation of food and energy worldwide.

The company's liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury pools the cash surpluses from across the different operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or invest the net surplus in a range of short dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments.

Reliance conducted a materiality assessment for the listed entity in FY 2021-22 to identify material issues based on international reporting standards. The assessment also prioritised key internal and external stakeholders with the most impact and influence on Reliance. Relevant stakeholder engagement mechanisms were used to capture the inputs of the identified stakeholders on the potential material issues. Each potential material issue was analysed in detail, taking into account the inputs from stakeholders and management. The material topics were then prioritised based on both management and stakeholder perspectives.

Impact on: . Oil to Chemicals \& Retail business

## Risk Description

The Russia Ukraine conflict and consequent US and EU sanctions on Russian crude oil, product and natural gas exports have the potential for creating shortages of crude oil and products and driving up prices. This can impact the availability of crude oil and cause a spike in price of feedstock. The high energy inflation could lead to headwinds for the global economy affecting oil demand and refining margins. There was unforeseen market scenario with a disruption of energy sources and oil supply mainly in the western regions due to geo-political developments between neighbouring countries of Ukraine and Russia. This has resulted in a shift in sourcing of energy and oil from alternate destinations, which has led to change in the trade-flows worldwide. The resultant longer sea passage has created shortage of availability of tankers and thus historically high volatility in freight rates. Further, the phased embargoes of Russian products that has come into place has created challenges which are likely to continue to be more complex for transportation of food and energy worldwide.

## Risk Description

Climate change continues to feature in the top 10 global risks cited by the Global Risk Report 2023. Global warming is having a compounding effect on the climate system, resulting in increased humanitarian challenges and further straining already stretched fiscal balances. For businesses, climate change risks manifests in two broader categories, namely physical and transition risks, as outlined by global frameworks. Physical risks refer to the potential impacts on a company caused by both short-term extreme weather events (acute) and long-term changes in climate patterns (chronic). On the other hand, transition risks pertain to the potential hazards businesses may face as the world transitions to a lower-carbon energy system which includes risks due to policy changes, legal action, technological advancements, shifts in supply and demand, and changes in stakeholder attitudes.

## Physical Risk

Throughout the year, an array of climate change induced weather events was experienced around the globe and in India too. These calamities included extreme weather events like intense heatwaves, cyclones, erratic rainfall, floods, and others, affecting almost every region of the country and causing unprecedented levels of destruction. Having a wide geographical spread, the organisation is susceptible to such erratic weather phenomenon which could cause disruptions in its operations and supply chains, in addition to causing negative impact on the wellbeing of our people and our assets. Additionally, long term changes in climate patterns causing rising temperatures and sea levels may also expose our operations to future impacts of worsening climate change, which can impact our business continuity in certain vulnerable regions.

## Risk Response

Reliance has robust business continuity management plans to manage risks arising from the physical impacts of climate change events. Each business segment after thorough evaluation of risks and its impact, develops these plans to ensure uninterrupted availability or swift recovery of essential business processes, resources and
operations. Regular review and testing are undertaken to ensure the effectiveness. The Global Corporate Security (GCS) team focuses on adopting pre-emptive, de-risking strategies to safeguard and secure operations from disasters, natural calamities, and any other disruptions or incidents at RIL.

Impact on: (1) , all businesses

## Risk Description

Our business operations have a vast geographical spread, both onshore as well as offshore. This makes Reliance vulnerable to manmade and natural disasters such as insider threat, social unrest, cyclones etc. These threats may be amplified by divisive use of social media networks. Geopolitical developments too can have a defining impact on business operations. These could cause harm to our assets, people, information and reputation. Even a seemingly minor incident has the potential to snowball and adversely impact our operations and stakeholders. Therefore, having high situational awareness with prompt and commensurate means to effectively respond in a proactive manner, is required to deal with all crises. Risk management and Business continuity plans are critical to ensure that business operations are not disrupted and if compromised, we should have the ability to restore the operations at the earliest. Some of the network locations, offices, employees and other ecosystems are subject to various forms of intentional or natural disruptions, thereby impacting network availability, customer experience, restoration cost and efforts. The growing E-commerce business is vulnerable to specific risks like Customer abuse (fake returns, related account abuse, fake claims - as order not received, empty box, wrong item received etc.), Account compromise, Brand infringement, Phishing/Vishing attacks etc. which are likely to increase manifolds. Of these, customer abuse is probably the most critical of risks. Fraudsters continue to innovate new methods to bypass system checks on Ecom platform/physical processes to defraud. There is thus a need to closely monitor these risks and have a robust mitigation strategy to protect business interests.

Interest Risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the plan's debt investments. Longevity Risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability. Salary Risk The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability. 29.2 Share Based Payments

## Treasury Risks

Impact on: (1), all businesses

## Risk Description

RIL faces following key financial risks which is actively managed by Treasury Team.

## Liquidity Risk

In FY 2022-23, inflation scaled higher in key economic regions of the globe on account of supply chain constraints. The onset of Russia Ukraine conflict drove commodity prices and inflation higher. Major central banks embarked on liquidity tightening measures through the year as inflation spiralled. On the domestic front too, banking liquidity and financial conditions tightened. Central banks are expected to calibrate their monetary stance based on the balance of risks of continuing inflation and those of financial stability. ## Interest Rate Risk

Reliance borrows funds from Domestic and International markets to meet its funding requirements. Faced with the scenario of spiralling inflation, central banks across the globe raised policy rates through the year. US Fed raised rates by 450 bps. RBI was also quick to respond to rising inflation in India and raised policy rates by 250 bps. The rise in global and domestic rates translates into higher finance costs for RIL.

## Foreign Exchange (FX) Risk

RIL avails LT and ST Foreign currency liabilities to fund its capital investments and working capital requirements. Rupee depreciation impacts the landed cost of the foreign currency liabilities. Given the steep rise in US interest rates, the Dollar remained strong against most currencies through the year. The INR depreciated sharply through first half of the year and closed the year with a depreciation of 8.4\%

## Credit Risk on Investment Portfolio

Reliance deploys its investible surplus in Government securities, State Government securities, AAA Corporate bonds, Fixed Deposits and Debt mutual funds. Corporate bonds and Debt Mutual Fund investments bear credit risk. ## Risk Response

RIL maintained healthy liquidity buffer as it had raised Long term Senior unsecured notes of 54.0 billion in January 2022. Even as liquidity tightened through the year, RIL and its subsidiaries accessed Short Term markets comfortably and raise short term INR liabilities (including Commercial Paper, Short-Term Loans and Overdrafts against FDs) to fund its working capital requirements. Reliance's Retail business too strengthened the liquidity position by raising Term Loans to fund its capex and business requirements.",72,ril_pdf_pages_semantic_p72_c0,"BM25, TF-IDF",0.025007766387076732,0.0,0.025007766387076732,3.3667360610616557,1
