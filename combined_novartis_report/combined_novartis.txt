# Chair's letter 

In our first full-year as a pure-play medicines company, Novartis delivered strong results, with double-digit growth in sales and net profit in 2024. The performance validates our strategy and gives us confidence that we are well prepared to grow by focusing on our key therapeutic areas and technology platforms.

The strategic shift from a diversified life sciences company to a focused medicines organization over the last decade has proven to be the right path forward. With the divestment of our non-core activities in animal health, vaccines and generics, among others, we were able to free up resources and strengthen our position in fast-growing and highly innovative medical fields such as xRNA, radioligand therapy and gene and cell therapy.

Our recent breakthroughs in breast cancer and kidney and blood diseases demonstrate that our operational focus strengthens our ability to deliver high-value medicines that alleviate society's greatest disease burdens. As we continue to accelerate our research and development efforts and strengthen our commercial capabilities, we expect to continue to grow profitably in the long-term and create sustainable shareholder value.

Our efforts to more efficiently align our Research, Development and Commercial organizations advanced further. Besides strategic acquisitions to increase our technological capacity and broaden our pipeline, we integrated artificial intelligence more deeply into our day-to-day operations to more efficiently assess new molecules and accelerate drug development timelines.

In view of continuing geopolitical and economic volatility, we are further strengthening our global production and distribution network to withstand potential supply chain disruptions and improve overall resilience. We will stay disciplined in managing our technical and data infrastructure as well as our partner networks and build an agile footprint to quickly adapt to the changing environment.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters remained high on our agenda. We deepened our commitment to vital topics: improving access to medicines, taking further measures in our fight against climate change and strengthening our ethics framework, among other things. Our efforts have been recognized by leading independent agencies and are reflected in consistently high rankings.

During my 12-year tenure as Chair, my priorities were, among others, to focus the company on its core pharmaceutical expertise, improve its governance, appoint strong executive leadership and help create a highly versatile Board of Directors to navigate the increasingly complex healthcare landscape. With Dr. Giovanni Caforio, who after shareholder approval is scheduled to join the Board as Non-Executive Chair in April 2025, Novartis has secured an outstanding leader to guide the company through its next phase.

I thank you for the confidence you have placed in our company and am pleased to be able to propose a dividend increase of 6\% to CHF 3.50 at the next Annual General Meeting.

Sincerely,
J. Reinhardt

Joerg Reinhardt
Chair of the Board of Directors

# CEO's letter 

2024 was a year of impact at Novartis. We reached nearly 300 million patients with our innovative therapies - more than ever before - as we built on the momentum from our successful transformation. We consistently delivered strong financial and operational performance, significant R\&D achievements, and sustainable growth, and are well positioned to increase value for shareholders and society moving forward.

Core to our approach is a relentless focus on innovation. It allowed us to develop and expand access to new treatments in our key therapeutic areas and technology platforms.

In oncology, we built on the legacy of our work in areas like breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia with Kisqali and Scemblix, medicines developed by researchers in Novartis labs - a testament to the strength of our R\&D engine. We secured our spot as a global leader in radioligand therapy (RLT), a platform we believe has the potential to transform cancer care. Pluvicto, our RLT therapy for advanced prostate cancer, showed strength in the US and Europe. We are exploring new referral pathways and investing in RLT manufacturing to broaden its global availability.

Our investments in cutting edge technology fueled innovation across therapeutic areas. We continue to prioritize platforms like RLT and RNA therapeutics, and increasingly integrate artificial intelligence and data science throughout our R\&D activities. These tools are helping uncover potential ways to accelerate drug design and clinical trial processes.

Through a combination of in-house R\&D and targeted acquisitions and licensing agreements, we now have more than 30 potential new high-value medicines in our pipeline and expect more than 15 submission-enabling readouts over the next two years.

We remain committed to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. We rank highly among industry peers in a range of key ESG ratings, and were honored to rank number one in the 2024 Access to Medicine Index.

Fostering a culture of innovation depends on people. We aim to recruit, retain, and cultivate the best talent in the world. It's why we've rebuilt our organization to meet tomorrow's global healthcare challenges through a simpler organization, targeted hiring efforts and investments in new facilities to serve patients around the world.
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Our approach delivered solid financial results. This past year saw double-digit growth in net sales and core operating income and improved core margins. Importantly, we delivered strong total shareholder returns for our shareholders over recent years.

Looking ahead, I'm confident we'll see sales growth average at least 5\% annually over the five years to 2029, and reach $40 \%$ core operating income margin by 2027. ${ }^{1}$

We're proud of our record and excited about the future. I want to offer a special note of thanks to outgoing Board Chair Joerg Reinhardt, who steps down after decades of leadership at Novartis. His impact will carry forward, and I'm grateful for his years of mentorship.

In recent years, we've narrowed our focus, expanded our reach, and invested in the future. The result is a strong portfolio of innovative therapies that sets us up for sustained growth and finds new ways to improve and extend patients' lives.

Thank you for making that possible. We look forward to continuing our momentum in 2025.

Sincerely,
![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

Our business faces significant risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Annual Report and in other documents we file with or furnish to the SEC, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in or to maintain an investment in any Novartis securities. Our business, as well as our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and share price, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or not currently considered material.

## Strategic risks

## Pricing, reimbursement and access

## Risk description

Pricing and reimbursement pressure, including pricing transparency and access to healthcare

## Context and potential impact

Our business has continuously experienced significant pressures on the pricing of our products and on our ability to obtain and maintain satisfactory rates of reimbursement for our products from governments, insurers and other payers. These pressures have many sources, including growth of healthcare costs as a percentage of gross domestic product; funding restrictions and policy changes; and public controversies, political debate, investigations and legal proceedings regarding pharmaceutical pricing. Pressures on pricing may negatively impact both our product pricing and the availability of our products.

In addition, we face numerous cost-containment measures imposed by governments and other payers. These include government-imposed, industrywide price reductions, mandatory pricing systems, reference pricing systems, payers limiting access to treatments based
on cost-benefit analyses, the importation of drugs from lower-cost countries to higher-cost countries, the shifting of the payment burden to patients through higher co-payments and co-pay accumulator programs, the limiting of physicians' ability to choose among competing medicines, the mandatory substitution of generic drugs for the patented equivalent, pressure on physicians to reduce the prescribing of patented prescription medicines, increasing pressure on intellectual property protections, and growing requirements for increased transparency on pricing. For more information on price controls, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview-Price controls."

Recent macroeconomic and geopolitical trends may have an impact on the likelihood of these pricing and reimbursement pressures occurring. Slow economic growth and the onset and expansion of war in certain parts of the world (which has contributed to challenges such as high energy costs and inflation) have led to increased strain on fiscal budgets in many major economies. In addition, legislative developments such as those in the US (e.g., the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA) and in Europe (e.g., the EU Joint Health Technology Assessment and 2023 EU Pharmaceutical Legislation Update) pose potential further pressures on pricing and timelines for reimbursement in these countries as legislators seek to reduce growth in healthcare spending. These external factors may materially affect our ability to protect value-based prices to achieve and maintain an acceptable return on our investments in the research and development of our products; and may impact our ability to research and develop new products. For example, in August 2024, we acceded to a "maximum fair price" under the US IRA for our cardiovascular drug Entresto for 2026 to avoid fines or the removal of all our products from both Medicare and Medicaid. Other products of ours may be selected for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program in the US or other price negotiation programs in the future.


### Page 13 ###

## Key products and commercial priorities

## Risk description

Failure to deliver key commercial priorities and successfully launch new products

## Context and potential impact

Our ability to maintain and grow our business and to replace revenue and income lost to generic, biosimilar and other competition depends heavily on the commercial success of our new or existing key products. The commercial success of these products could be impacted at any time by a number of factors, including pressure from new or existing competitive products, changes in the prescribing habits of healthcare professionals, slower than expected post-launch adoption, unexpected side effects or safety signals, supply chain issues or other product shortages, pricing pressure, regulatory proceedings, changes in labeling, loss of intellectual property protection, and global pandemics. In addition, our revenue and margins could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of new products.

We operate in competitive and rapidly changing markets and could be adversely affected if we fail to keep pace with technological changes. Healthcare professionals, patients and payers may choose competitor products instead of ours for various reasons, including if they perceive them to be better in terms of efficacy, safety, cost, convenience or other reasons. The commercial success of our key products and launches in the face of increasing competition requires significant attention, management focus and resource allocation. Such competition could significantly affect the revenue from our products and our results of operations. This impact could also be compounded to the extent that such competition results in us making significant additional investments in research and development, marketing or sales. The continual development and usage of advanced technologies for new products and product enhancements is an important way in which we deliver our key commercial priorities and remain competitive. If we fail to keep pace with technological changes in our industry, including through the use of new and disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), we may experience lower revenues and lower margins.

Furthermore, from time to time, we reassess how our business is organized to help ensure that we have the optimal structure with which to execute our strategy. An inability to successfully implement new organizational structures and operating models could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

## Research and development

## Risk description

Failure to competitively discover and develop innovative medicines in our core therapeutic areas and leveraging our technology platforms

## Context and potential impact

We engage in extensive and costly research and development activities, both through our own internal
resources and through collaborations with third parties, in an effort to identify and develop new products and new indications for existing products that address unmet, ever-changing medical needs, while ensuring commercial viability and success. Our ability to grow our business and our product pipeline; to replace sales lost due to branded competition, entry of generics, or other reasons; and to bring products to market that take advantage of new and potentially disruptive technologies, including cell, gene and radioligand therapies, depends in significant part on the success of these efforts.

Failure to successfully develop our pipeline products is typically the result of the inherent uncertainty of science, suboptimal internal execution, or both. Key elements of internal execution include our ability to prioritize our investments in our highest potential value assets, optimize the transition of assets from research to development, integrate externally acquired assets in an efficient way, and execute the steps in our drug development process that enable our assets to be approved and reimbursed in a timely manner to positively impact clinical practice. We invest in new businesses, products, services and technologies, including AI, to achieve our goals, operate our business and reduce the time, effort and expense associated with identifying, developing and commercializing new products. Our investments in new technologies may not ultimately achieve the intended benefits, may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. Further, a failure to successfully implement AI as part of our R\&D strategy may put us at a competitive disadvantage and impact our productivity and pipeline value. For more information, see also "Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business over-view-Research and development."

Our new products must undergo intensive preclinical and clinical testing and are approved by means of a highly complex, lengthy, and expensive approval process that varies substantially from country to country and may have specific requirements for the recruitment of patients for clinical trials. Additionally, if we fail to successfully progress late-stage assets and the core elements of drug development for key programs, this could have a negative impact on the development of our product pipeline, and ultimately on the success of our business and our financial results.

We may be unable to develop the necessary clinical evidence to support the desired indications and product profile for a particular disease that is needed to drive clinical adoption of our new products, and thereby achieve the full potential of our assets (also known as the "target product profile"). It is increasingly challenging to adequately recruit a sufficient number of patients in the US for clinical trials due to the cost and effort associated with expanding our operations for the recruitment of patients into such trials. Similarly, the post-approval regulatory burden has also increased, and may continue to increase, as regulators are increasingly focused on long-term data. These requirements make the maintenance of regulatory approvals and label expansions for our products increasingly expensive, and further heighten the risk of recalls, product withdrawals, changes to product specifications, loss of market share, and loss of revenue and profitability.


### Page 14 ###

The clinical testing, regulatory processes and post-approval activities described above have become, and may in the future continue to become, more difficult during pandemics and periods of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. This is due to challenges related to recruiting, enrolling and treating patients in clinical trials, as well as ensuring the supply of trial materials.

Furthermore, our research and development activities must be conducted in an ethical and compliant manner. Among other things, we are concerned with patient safety (both pre- and post-product approval), data privacy, current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP) requirements, data integrity, the fair treatment of patients, diversity and inclusion in the recruitment of patients to clinical trials, and animal welfare. If we fail to properly manage such issues, we risk injury to third parties, damage to our reputation, negative financial consequences as a result of potential claims for damages, sanctions and fines, and the potential that investments in research and development activities may not bring the expected benefits to us. For a further description of the research and development of, and approval processes for, our products, see "Research and development" and "Regulation" under "Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview."

## Intellectual property

## Risk description

Expiry, assertion or loss of intellectual property protection

## Context and potential impact

Many of our products are protected by intellectual property rights, including patents and regulatory exclusivities, which may provide us with exclusive rights to market those products for a limited time, to enable our purpose of reimagining medicine by sustainably financing our research and development. However, the strength and duration of those rights can vary significantly from product to product and from country to country, and they may be successfully challenged by third parties or governmental authorities.

If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic or biosimilar versions of our branded products or from using our proprietary technologies. Intellectual property protection relating to particular compound forms, uses, formulations, or processes may not preclude third parties from designing around our rights in order to compete with our products. Loss of intellectual property protection and the introduction of generic or biosimilar competition for a patented branded medicine in a country typically result in a significant reduction in net sales and operating income for the branded product. Such competition can occur after successful challenges to intellectual property rights or the regular expiration of the patent term or other intellectual property rights. Such competition can also result from the entry of generic or biosimilar versions of another medicine in the same therapeutic class as one of our drugs or in a competing therapeutic class, from a

Declaration of Public Interest or the compulsory licensing of our intellectual property by governmental authorities, or as a result of a general weakening of intellectual property and governing laws in certain countries around the world. In addition, generic or biosimilar manufacturers may sometimes launch products "at risk" before the final resolution of legal proceedings concerning the infringement or validity of relevant patents or regulatory exclusivities.

We also rely in all aspects of our businesses on unpatented proprietary technology, know-how, trade secrets and other confidential information, which we seek to protect through various measures, including confidentiality agreements with employees, licensees, third-party collaborators, contractors and consultants who may have had access to such information. If these agreements are breached or our other protective measures should fail, we may not be able to prevent a third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or other intellectual property without authorization, and our contractual or other remedies may not be adequate to cover our losses. Further, others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical products that circumvent our intellectual property by means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.

In addition, third parties may claim that our products or business infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. Claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violations can be costly and time-consuming to resolve and may delay or prevent product launches. If successful, these actions may involve payment of future royalties or damages (including treble damages on US sales if we are found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party) and may also involve injunctive relief requiring the removal of one or more dosage strengths of a product from the market (or removal of a therapeutic indication from the product's approved labeling) for a period of time or throughout the life of the asserted intellectual property right. Such damages or such an injunction may have a material impact on our operating income and net sales. In any given year, we may experience a potentially significant impact on our net sales from products that have already lost intellectual property protection, as well as products that may lose protection during the year.

A third party may also claim that our owned or licensed patent rights are not infringed, or are invalid or unenforceable in a litigation. The outcome following such legal assertions is unpredictable, and the loss of patent rights as a result of such assertions could result in the introduction of generic or biosimilar competition for, and reduction in sales of, the branded product covered by such patent rights. The outcome may also result in our inability to obtain fair value for the use of our patents, or to obtain an injunction preventing the unlicensed practice of our patents. In addition, intellectual property protection in certain jurisdictions outside the EU and US is weak and we face heightened risks to our intellectual property rights in these jurisdictions, including competition with generic, infringing or counterfeit versions of our products at or after launch.


### Page 15 ###

Because we may have substantially reduced marketing and research and development expenses related to products that are in their final years of exclusivity, the initial loss of protection for a product during a given year could also have an impact on our operating income for that year in an amount corresponding to a significant portion of the product's lost sales. The magnitude of the impact of generic or biosimilar competition on our income could depend on a number of factors. These include, with respect to income in a given year, the time of year at which the generic or biosimilar competitor is launched; the ease or difficulty of manufacturing a competitor product and obtaining regulatory approval to market it; the number of generic or biosimilar competitor products approved, including whether, in the US, a single competitor is granted an exclusive marketing period; whether an authorized generic is launched; the geographies in which generic or biosimilar competitor products are approved, including the strength of the market for generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical products in such geographies, and the comparative profitability of branded pharmaceutical products in such geographies; and our ability to successfully develop and launch new products for patients that may also offset the income lost to generic or biosimilar competition. For more information on the patent and generic competition status of our products, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview-Intellectual property."

## Alliances, acquisitions and integration

## Risk description

Failure to identify, execute or realize the expected benefits from our external business opportunities

## Context and potential impact

As part of our strategy as a focused innovative medicines company, we routinely evaluate external opportunities that could strengthen our portfolio by acquiring and divesting products, entering businesses or entering into strategic alliances and collaborations. Additionally, strategic deals with new technology platforms and ear-ly-stage companies contribute to our innovation. For example, in 2024, we closed the acquisitions of MorphoSys AG, Mariana Oncology and Kate Therapeutics, and entered into several strategic partnerships for the development and commercialization of innovative products across our core therapeutic areas. This strategy relies on our ability to identify strategic external business opportunities, which may be limited, including assessing the value of early-stage companies ahead of competition, and to close transactions with third parties on mutually acceptable terms. The market for clinical-stage assets and cutting-edge technology platforms within our core therapeutic areas is highly competitive and we may be unsuccessful in acquiring businesses or assets or entering into strategic partnerships that may complement our existing portfolio.

Once the key terms of a strategic transaction have been agreed with a third party, we may not be able to complete the transaction as the result of, among other things, disagreement on the contractual terms or negative due diligence results. In addition, we cannot be sure that pre-transaction due diligence will identify all
possible issues that might arise during and after the transaction. Our efforts on such transactions can also divert management's attention from our existing businesses and pursuing multiple transactions at the same time may impact our ability to efficiently conduct appropriate levels of pre-transaction technical due diligence, and to consummate such transactions.

After a transaction is closed, efforts to develop and commercialize acquired or licensed products, to integrate the acquired business or to achieve expected synergies may fail or may not fully meet expectations. This may occur due to difficulties in retaining key personnel, customers and suppliers; failure to obtain marketing approval or reimbursement within expected timeframes or at all; differences in corporate culture, standards, controls, processes and policies; or other factors. Transactions can also result in liabilities being incurred that were not known at the time of acquisition, or the creation of tax or accounting issues. Acquired businesses are not always in full compliance with legal, regulatory or Novartis standards, including, for example, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) or cGCP standards, which can be costly and time-consuming to remediate. Furthermore, our strategic alliances and collaborations with third parties may not achieve their intended goals and objectives within expected time frames, or at all. For more information about recent business acquisitions, see "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 2. Significant acquisitions of businesses and spin-off of Sandoz business."

Similarly, we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully divest or spin off businesses or other assets that we have identified for this purpose; or that any completed divestment or spin-off will achieve the expected strategic benefits, operational efficiencies or opportunities; or that the divestment or spin-off will ultimately maximize shareholder value.

## Environmental, social and governance matters

## Risk description

Failure to meet rapidly evolving environmental, social and governance expectations

## Context and potential impact

Increasingly, in addition to financial results, companies are being scrutinized by various stakeholders for their performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, which can impact the longterm sustainability of a company's performance. An inability to successfully perform on ESG matters and to meet heightened and sometimes conflicting stakeholder expectations could result in negative impacts on our reputation, recruitment, retention, operations, financial results and share price.

Topics related to large societal changes such as social inequity, access to medicines and climate change are increasingly important to a wide range of our stakeholders. For example, a variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. In addition, investments in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments are popular, and major institutional investors have publicly


### Page 16 ###

emphasized the importance of such ESG measures in making their investment decisions. Our actions related to ESG topics may, in the long term, impact our operations and ability to achieve our strategic goals, and ultimately could have a potential negative impact on the value of Novartis.

We actively manage a broad range of ESG matters, taking into consideration their expected impact on the sustainability of our business over time, and the potential impact of our business on society and the environment. Our Sustainability \& ESG Office, under guidance of the ESG Committee of the Executive Committee of Novartis, is tasked with developing our ESG strategy and tracking our performance against our ESG targets. Considering the fast pace of change of external expectations, including a range of upcoming regulations, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, that the ESG standards we currently use to measure our performance against will remain the same, or that we will successfully meet society's or investors' expectations. Failure to meet rapidly evolving regulatory requirements, investor and societal expectations could also result in litigation or regulatory actions, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, recruitment, retention, operations, financial results, and share price. Additionally, partners in our value chain that we do not control may not comply with ESG commitments and goals we set for ourselves, which may have a negative impact on our business.

## Sandoz spin-off

## Risk description

We may not successfully achieve our goals related to our separation from Sandoz and our failure to do so may have an adverse impact on our business

## Context and potential impact

In 2023, we completed the separation of Sandoz, our generics and biosimilars division, into a new Swiss publicly traded independent company, by way of a 100\% spin-off. In connection with the Sandoz separation, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements. These agreements govern the separation and distribution and the relationship between Novartis and Sandoz going forward, including with respect to the allocation of assets and liabilities between Novartis and Sandoz. The agreements also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other company for a period of time. The terms, scope and/or duration of these agreements could negatively impact our ability to pursue other strategic business interests as we will have to devote resources and capacity to fulfill our obligations that we may prefer to direct elsewhere. If we or Sandoz are unable to satisfy our respective obligations under these agreements, we could incur losses or experience operational challenges or difficulties. These agreements could also lead to disputes over the performance of obligations under these agreements or the allocation of our respective resources. For example, during the term of these agreements, we may have less flexibility to optimize our biologic manufacturing for our own products (or those of other third parties). In addition, pursuant to these
agreements, we will perform technical development services for Sandoz, which may involve certain proprietary know-how. While we intend to retain the personnel involved in our technical research and development and to protect our trade secrets, provision of such services might create the incremental potential for the disclosure or misuse of such proprietary know-how, particularly in connection with technology transfer at the end of such arrangements.

Further, if the spin-off does not generally qualify as a tax-neutral transaction for Swiss and US federal income tax purposes, we, our shareholders, or both, could be subject to significant tax liabilities. The spin-off is intended to qualify for tax-neutral treatment for us and our shareholders for Swiss and US federal income tax purposes. If, however, the spin-off fails to qualify as tax-neutral for Swiss and US federal income tax purposes, we, our shareholders, or both, could recognize taxable gain with respect to the spin-off, resulting in Swiss and US income, withholding and capital gains tax consequences. In particular, if the spin-off does not qualify as tax neutral for Swiss and US federal income tax purposes, our shareholders who received shares of Sandoz in the spin-off as part of the separation would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.

## Operational risks

## Cybersecurity and data protection

## Risk description

Cybersecurity breaches, data loss and catastrophic loss of IT systems

## Context and potential impact

We are heavily dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology (IT) systems, including internet-based systems to support our business processes. We also outsource significant parts of our IT infrastructure to third-party providers, including those who provide AI services and technology, and currently use these providers to perform business-critical IT services for us. We are therefore vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and incidents on such networks and systems, whether our own or those of the third-party providers that we contract, and we have experienced, and may in the future experience, such cybersecurity threats and attacks. Cybersecurity threats and attacks take many forms, and the size, age and complexity of our IT systems make them potentially vulnerable to external and internal security threats; outages; malicious intrusions and attacks; cybercrimes, including state-sponsored cybercrimes; malware; ransomware; misplaced data, lost data or data errors; programming or human errors; or other similar events. We may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The risk of such threats and attacks has increased, in part due to the rise of AI, and as virtual and remote working have become more common, and sensitive data is accessed by employees working in less secure, home-based environments. In addition, due to


### Page 17 ###

our reliance on third-party providers, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions, delays or outages in IT service availability due to a variety of factors outside of our control, including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or security attacks experienced by or caused by third-party providers. Interruptions in the service provided by these third parties could affect our ability to perform critical tasks.

A significant information security or other event, such as a disruption or loss of availability of one or more of our IT systems, whether managed by us or a third-party service provider, has previously and could in the future negatively impact important business processes, such as the conduct of scientific research and clinical trials, the submission of data and information to health authorities, our manufacturing and supply chain processes, our shipments to customers, our compliance with legal obligations, and communication between employees and with third parties. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information (including but not limited to intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information). IT issues have previously led to, and could in the future lead to, the compromise of trade secrets, confidential information or other intellectual property that could be sold and used by competitors to accelerate the development or manufacturing of competing products; the compromise of personal financial and health information; and the compromise of IT security data such as usernames, passwords and encryption keys, as well as security strategies and information about network infrastructure, which could allow unauthorized parties to gain access to additional systems or data. In addition, malfunctions in software or medical devices that make significant use of IT could lead to a risk of direct harm to patients. The costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material and any cybersecurity insurance that we may have in place may not cover such expenses. If the information technology systems of our third-party providers become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third parties and we may have to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring.

The occurrence of any of the events described above in the future could disrupt our business operations and result in enforcement actions or liability, including potential government fines and penalties, claims for damages, and shareholder litigation or allegations that the public health, or the health of individuals, has been harmed.

Any significant events of this type could require us to expend significant resources beyond those we already invest to remediate any damage, to further modify or enhance our protective measures, and to enable the continuity of our business.

## Talent and external workforce management

## Risk description

Inability to identify, attract, develop and retain qualified talent for critical roles or to effectively manage our external workforce could hinder our growth and result in
increased information security, data and legal compliance risks

## Context and potential impact

We rely on identifying, attracting, developing and retaining a diverse, highly skilled workforce across our business and functions to achieve our objectives. If we are unable to sustain our supply of key personnel-including senior members of our scientific and management teams, high-quality researchers and development specialists and skilled employees with key capabilities in key markets-our ability to achieve our major business objectives may be adversely affected. In addition, our brand and reputation could be negatively impacted.

The market for skilled talent has become increasingly competitive, and we anticipate this trend will persist in the long term. We face a challenge to attract and retain top talent in several areas, including biology, immunology, chemistry, clinical development, drug manufacturing, data, digital and IT, oncology, and advanced therapy platforms (i.e., gene and cell therapy, radioligand therapy and xRNA) and to maintain and strengthen our employer reputation. In addition, many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and research centers, and government entities with significant capital are not only competing with us to attract the same skilled talent but are also aggressively pursuing our experienced talent. Additionally, if the performance of our leadership and management fail to build upon our capabilities, the results could be suboptimal performance of our teams and misalignment with strategic goals, and could hinder our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified talent in critical roles. Furthermore, if we are unable to retain and engage key talent of companies that we acquire and integrate, we may not be able to realize the full value of these acquisitions.

In recent years, we have adopted new ways of working that include location flexibility and increasingly recruiting from a global pool of talent. However, the success of our business continues to depend on having employees who possess local knowledge of, and experience in, our key markets. The external talent supply is especially limited in many of the geographies that are expected to be sources of growth for us. In the US, China and several other markets, the geographic mobility of talent is decreasing, as they find ample career opportunities available closer to home. Additionally, if we are unable to manage our external workforce effectively it could lead to suboptimal access to external capabilities, limited cost management, reduced engagement, increased IT and compliance risks, and impaired strategic decision-making.

The risks associated with the challenging talent market will be exacerbated if we are unable to retain and effectively develop employees, or to maintain an internal pipeline with critical skills, experiences, and leadership to deliver our business priorities. As a result, development, engagement, motivation, succession planning and performance rewards for our critical talent are essential to achieving our business priorities.


### Page 18 ###

## Strategic technology programs implementation

## Risk description

Failure to successfully implement our IT strategy may disrupt our core business processes

## Context and potential impact

We rely on various IT systems to operate our complex global business and several of our current IT systems are reaching the end of their useful life, which could cause disruptions to our operational stability. As a result, we are implementing several companywide IT programs to replace and consolidate outdated IT systems and to simplify and standardize our processes, systems and tools, and create a unified data marketplace. Implementation and operation of these new systems involves certain risks, including the potential for a failure of the new systems to operate as expected; a failure to properly integrate new systems with other systems we use; delays in adopting and scaling new systems; potential loss of data or information; a failure of, or potential issues with, systems related to our payment and procurement processes; compliance issues; and cost overruns and delays. Our inability to timely and successfully implement our IT strategy may prevent us from materializing expected business benefits or capitalizing on opportunities and could lead to business disruptions, cost inefficiencies and potential exposure to legal, regulatory and reputational risks as our internal controls could be negatively affected. Any disruptions or malfunctions of new systems could cause critical information to be delayed, lost, defective, corrupted, or rendered inadequate or inaccessible, which could negatively impact our operations, the effectiveness of our internal controls and financial condition.

## Legal, regulatory, ethics and compliance

## Risk description

Challenges posed by evolving legal and regulatory requirements, innovative and disruptive technologies, and societal expectations regarding ethical behavior

## Context and potential impact

We are subject to an extensive and complex framework of laws and regulations across the jurisdictions in which we operate.

The laws and regulations relevant to the healthcare industry and applicable to us are broad in scope, are subject to change, and have evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our business practices. For example, we have been, are currently, and may in the future be, subject to various significant legal proceedings, such as private party litigation, government investigations and law enforcement actions worldwide. These types of matters may take various forms based on evolving government enforcement and private party litigation priorities, and could include, among other things, matters pertaining to: pricing; bribery and corruption; trade regulation and embargo legislation; product liability; commercial disputes; employment and wrongful discharge; antitrust and competition; securities; government benefit programs; reimbursement; rebates; healthcare fraud; sales and marketing practices; insider
trading; occupational health and safety; environmental regulations; tax; cyber and data security; use of technologies, including AI; data privacy; regulatory interactions; disclosure compliance; and intellectual property. Such matters can involve civil or criminal proceedings and can retroactively challenge practices previously considered to be legal.

There is also a risk that governance of our medical and patient support activities, and of our interactions with governments, public officials/institutions, healthcare professionals, healthcare organizations and patient organizations may be inadequate or fail, or that we may undertake activities based on improper or inadequate scientific justification.

New requirements may also be imposed on us due to changing government and societal expectations regarding the healthcare industry, and acceptable corporate behavior generally. For example, we are faced with laws and regulations requiring changes in how we do business, including with respect to disclosures concerning our interactions with healthcare professionals, healthcare organizations and patient organizations. These laws and regulations include requirements that we disclose payments or other transfers of value made to healthcare professionals and organizations, as well as information relating to the costs and prices for our products, which represent evolving standards of acceptable corporate behavior. These requirements may cause us to incur significant costs, including substantial time and additional resources, that are necessary to bring our interactions with healthcare professionals and organizations into compliance with these evolving standards. There is also an increased risk of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations as we pursue new strategies and make organizational changes that may cause responsibilities for compliance matters to become unclear. An actual or alleged failure to comply with the law or with heightened public expectations could lead to substantial liabilities, fines, penalties or other losses that may not be covered by insurance adequately or at all.

Legal proceedings and investigations are inherently unpredictable, and significant judgments sometimes occur. Consequently, we may in the future incur judgments that could involve large payments, including the potential repayment of amounts allegedly obtained improperly, and other penalties, including treble damages. In addition, such legal proceedings and investigations, even if meritless, may affect our reputation, may create a risk of potential exclusion from government reimbursement programs in the US and other countries, and may lead to civil litigation or criminal exposure. As a result, we have in the past and may again in the future enter into major settlements of such claims without bringing them to final legal adjudication, despite having potentially significant defenses against them, to limit the risks they pose to our business and reputation. Such settlements may require us to pay significant sums of money and to enter into corporate integrity or similar agreements, which are intended to regulate company behavior for extended periods. From time to time, we may also initiate challenges to laws or regulations that we believe are illegal or unconstitutional. The result of such litigation we may pursue is inherently uncertain and may negatively impact our business and reputation.


### Page 19 ###

In addition, regardless of the outcome of any legal proceedings, such proceedings are costly and time-consuming and require significant attention from our management and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

For information on significant legal matters pending against us, see "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 20. Provisions and other non-current liabilities" and "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 27. Commitments and contingent liabilities."

## External partner risk management and human rights

## Risk description

Failure to maintain adequate governance and risk oversight over external partner relationships, and failure of external partners to meet their contractual, regulatory or other obligations

## Context and potential impact

We rely on external partners for the performance of certain key business functions and services, including, among others, research and development, manufacturing operations and warehousing and distribution, certain finance functions, sales and marketing activities and data management. Many of our external partners do not have internal compliance systems or resources comparable to ours. As a result, our investment and efforts in relation to external partner management include focusing on risk management and the oversight of such external partners.

Our reliance on external partners poses certain risks, including the misappropriation of our intellectual property, the failure of the external partner to comply with our standards, including regulatory standards; societal expectations; environmental, anti-bribery and human rights standards and regulations; quality assurance requirements; unexpected supply disruptions; breach of our agreement by the external partner; and the unexpected termination or nonrenewal of our agreement by the external partner. Any of these risks could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under applicable laws or significant regulatory penalties, and could disrupt our operations and have a negative impact on our reputation.

In addition, governments require us, and the public may expect us, to take responsibility for and report on compliance with various human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental practices, as well as other actions of our external partners around the world.

Ultimately, if external partners fail to meet their obligations to us, we may lose our investment in the relationship with the external partners or fail to receive the expected benefits of our agreements with such external partners. While we aim to identify and assess any risk of harm to society caused by our external partners' operations, should any of these external partners fail to comply with the law or our standards, or should they otherwise act inappropriately while performing services for us, we could be held responsible for their acts, our reputation may suffer, and penalties could be imposed on us.

## Manufacturing and product quality

## Risk description

Inability to ensure proper controls in product development and product manufacturing, and failure to comply with applicable regulations and standards

## Context and potential impact

The development and manufacture of our products is complex and heavily regulated by governmental health authorities around the world, which may vary by country. Healthcare systems, healthcare providers and patients rely on us to meet the highest quality standards. Regardless of whether our products and the related raw materials are developed and manufactured at our own manufacturing sites or by third parties, we must ensure that all development, manufacturing, quality and supply processes comply with regulatory requirements, as well as our own quality standards in order to deliver novel therapies while ensuring patient safety. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of products, injunctions, product recalls, failure to secure product approvals, debarment, or harm to patients or our reputation.

In recent years, global health authorities have substantially intensified their scrutiny of manufacturers' compliance with regulatory requirements. Any significant failure by us or our third-party suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements, or with health authorities' expectations, may create the need to suspend clinical trials, suspend manufacturing, shut down production facilities or production lines, and recall clinical or commercial products. Additionally, we may acquire new companies or technology platforms that may not fully comply with regulatory requirements or expectations, which may pose legal, financial and reputation risks for us post-acquisition. A failure to fully comply with regulatory requirements could also lead to a delay in the approval of new products, an inability to ship or import our products, and significant penalties and reputational harm.

In addition, the technically complex manufacturing processes required to manufacture many of our products increase the risk of both production failures and product recalls, and can increase the cost of producing our goods. Some of our products require a supply of highly specialized raw materials, such as cell lines, tissue samples, bacteria, viral strains and radioisotopes. In addition, we manufacture and sell a number of sterile products, biologic products and products that involve advanced therapy platforms, such as gene and cell therapy, radioligand therapy, and xRNA, all of which are particularly complex and involve highly specialized manufacturing technologies. For more information, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B. Business over-view-Production." As a result, even slight deviations at any point in their production processes or in the materials used have led to, and may in the future lead to, production failures or recalls.


### Page 20 ###

## Supply chain

## Risk description

Inability to maintain continuity of product supply

## Context and potential impact

Many of our products are produced using technically complex manufacturing processes and require a supply of highly specialized raw materials. For some of our products and raw materials, we may rely on a single source of supply. In addition, we manufacture and sell a number of sterile products, biologic products, and products that involve advanced therapy platforms, such as gene and cell therapy, radioligand therapy, and xRNA, all of which are particularly complex and involve highly specialized manufacturing technologies. Due to this complexity, there is a risk of production and supply of critical raw materials failures, which may result in supply interruptions or product recalls due to manufactured products not meeting required specifications.

In addition, due to the inherent complexities of our manufacturing processes and the supply chains for advanced therapy platforms, we are required to plan our production activities and purchase of materials well in advance. If we suffer from third-party raw material shortages, underestimate market demand for a product, or fail to accurately predict when a new product will be approved for sale, then we may not be able to produce sufficient product to meet demand. These issues could be made worse during a pandemic, or as a result of macroeconomic factors or geopolitical events, such as military actions and wars in certain parts of the world, and could lead to a sudden increase in demand for selected medicinal products, resulting in the short-term unavailability of critical materials; logistical and supply challenges that may lead to our inability to ship products from one location to another due to restrictions imposed; or our inability to properly operate a manufacturing site due to restrictions imposed.

Our or our suppliers' inability to manage such issues could lead to shutdowns, product shortages, or to us being entirely unable to supply products to patients for an extended period of time. Furthermore, as our products are intended to promote the health of patients, such shortages or shutdowns could harm our reputation and have led to, and could continue in the future to lead to, significant losses of sales revenue, potential litigation or allegations that the public health, or the health of individuals, has been harmed.

## Data privacy

## Risk description

Noncompliance with personal data protection laws and regulations

## Context and potential impact

We operate in an industry that relies on the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation of large sets of patients' and other individuals' personal information, including via social media and mobile technologies. The operation of our business requires data to flow to our third-party contractors' systems and across the borders of numerous countries in which there are different, potentially conflicting, and frequently changing, data privacy
laws in effect. Examples of such laws include: the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); Brazil's General Personal Data Protection Law; the Personal Information Protection Law in China; and different comprehensive consumer privacy laws in multiple US states. Such laws impose stringent requirements on how we and third parties with whom we contract collect, share, export, protect or otherwise process personal information, and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. Security breaches of our systems or those of our third-party contractors, or other failures to protect the data we collect from misuse or breach by third parties, could expose such personal information to unauthorized persons which could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under applicable data privacy laws and significant regulatory penalties, and which could disrupt our operations and have a negative impact on our reputation.

Events involving the substantial loss or unlawful access or disclosure of personal information, use of personal information without a legal basis, or other privacy violations could give rise to significant liability, reputational harm, damaged relationships with business partners, and potentially substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions under laws enacted or being enacted around the world. Such events could also lead to restrictions on our ability to use personal information and/or transfer personal information across country borders, which could interfere with critical business operations. In addition, there is a trend of increasing divergence of data privacy legal frameworks, not only across these frameworks but also within individual legal frameworks themselves. This divergence may increase compliance costs, constrain the implementation of global business processes and may lead to different approaches on the use of health data for scientific research, which may have a negative impact on our business and operations.

## Falsified medicines

## Risk description

Impact of falsified medicines on patient safety, and reputational and financial harm to us and our products

## Context and potential impact

We continue to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to falsified medicines, which, as defined by the World Health Organization, include counterfeit, stolen, tampered and illegally diverted medicines.

Falsified medicines pose patient safety risks and can be seriously harmful or life-threatening. Reports of adverse events related to falsified medicines and increased levels of falsified medicines in the healthcare system affect patient confidence in genuine medicines and in healthcare systems in general. These events could also cause us substantial reputational and financial harm, and potentially lead to litigation if the adverse event from a falsified medicine is mistakenly attributed to our products. Stolen or illegally diverted medicines that are not properly stored and are later sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. Furthermore, there is a direct financial loss when falsified medicines replace sales of our products, or our products are recalled following the discovery of falsified products.


### Page 21 ###

## Emerging risks

## Geopolitical developments

## Risk description

Impact of geo- and socio-political threats

## Context and potential impact

Geopolitical and social tensions and conflicts, such as government shutdowns, changes in government administrations, sovereign risks, acts of war or aggression and terrorist activities, have both a direct and indirect impact on the pharmaceutical industry and our operations. As a result of such tensions conflicts, certain countries have adopted or may in the future adopt additional, protectionist measures including the imposition of tariffs. Tariffs that are intended to shield domestic markets from foreign competition and the possibility of additional trade restrictions, such as export controls, could have a material impact on our business. If tariffs or export controls on pharmaceutical products or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) were increased in certain parts of the world, our supply chain and flow of our products could be immediately disrupted. There is also an additional risk that aggressive monetary and fiscal policies by governments and central banks to curb inflation may prompt market-specific recessions and raise the cost-of-living, further putting pressure on pricing and cost containment for the pharmaceutical industry.

Collectively, unstable geo- and socio-political conditions could, among other things, disturb the international flow of goods and increase the costs and difficulties of international transactions. This could potentially impact our ability to develop and supply our products to patients in an undisrupted fashion, and further erode reimbursement mechanisms for our medicines.

## Macroeconomic developments

## Risk description

Impact of macroeconomic developments

## Context and potential impact

Our business may be impacted by deteriorating macroeconomic and financial conditions directly affecting us, our suppliers, payers and consumers. Given that patients, in many countries, directly pay a sizable and increasing portion of their own healthcare costs, there is a risk that patients may cut back on prescription drugs due to financial constraints.

Negative macroeconomic developments may also adversely affect the ability of payers, as well as our distributors, customers, suppliers, and service providers, to pay for our products or to buy necessary inventory or raw materials, and to perform their obligations under agreements with us. Weakening growth, unstable market conditions and rising debt service costs may also increase the credit risk of our counterparties. Although we make efforts to monitor the financial condition and liquidity of these third parties, our ability to do so is limited, and some of them may become unable to fulfill their obligations in a timely manner or may even become insolvent. These risks may be elevated with respect to our interactions with fiscally challenged government payers,
or with third parties with substantial exposure to such payers.

At the same time, significant changes, and potential future volatility in financial markets, the consumer and business environment, the competitive landscape, and the global political and security landscape make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our revenues and earnings, which may impact the success of our mid- and long-term planning.

Asset price corrections in financial markets may also result in lower returns on our financial investments. In addition, pricing pressures in developed markets resulting from efforts to reduce the cost of healthcare (e.g., the US IRA, which targets drug prices) may have a negative impact on our revenue and our net sales. In addition, inflation may have an impact on our operating costs in the form of higher prices for supplies, energy, raw materials, wages, and capital, which could reduce our net income.

Uncertainties around future central bank and other economic policies in the US and EU, including elevated interest rates, government shutdowns, debt ceilings or government funding, could also impact world trade. Sudden increases in economic, currency or financial market volatility in different countries, such as appreciation of the US dollar, have also impacted, and may continue to have an unpredictable impact on our business, or results of operations, including the conversion of our operating results into our reporting currency, the US dollar, as well as the value of our investments in our pension plans.

For more information about the effect of price controls on our business, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B-Business overview-Price controls." See also "Item 5.

Failure to manage physical and transition risks from climate change

## Context and potential impact

We are exposed to a broad range of climate risks such as transition risks (e.g., regulatory frameworks, carbon pricing, and the cost of and access to capital) and physical risks (e.g., heat, water scarcity, rising sea levels, and flooding from severe weather events), which could vary in magnitude and impact across different countries.

Climate change has triggered, and may continue to trigger, the adoption of new regulatory requirements across the globe, such as in Switzerland, the EU, the United Kingdom, or Australia, as well as rapidly evolving societal expectations. As a result, we may be required to increase our investment in technology to reduce our energy use, water use and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, legislative and regulatory action, both current and in the future, includes or could include, carbon


### Page 22 ###

pricing, climate risk-related disclosures, and changes in zoning or building codes to increase climate resilience. As a result, the combined impact of these transition risks could increase our direct operating costs or be passed on to us through the impact on our supply chain. Further, any failure to achieve climate-related commitments we have made in the past, or that we make in the future, in the expected timeframe, or at all, could result in negative impacts on our reputation, our operations, and the price of our shares.

Climate change has created, and will continue to create, physical risks to our business and our supply chain. Some of our production facilities and supplier locations that depend on the availability of significant water supplies are located in areas where fresh water is increasingly scarce. Other facilities and suppliers are located in areas that, due to increasingly violent weather events, rising sea levels, or both, are increasingly at risk of substantial damage. In regions where such a risk is present, this has an impact not only on our own operations but also our distributed supply chain. Such events may result in the loss of life, increased costs, business interruptions, destruction of facilities, and disruption to healthcare systems that patients use to access our medicines.

## Tax laws and developments

## Risk description

Changes in tax laws or their application

## Context and potential impact

Our multinational operations are taxed under the laws of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in tax laws or in their application could lead to an increased risk of international tax disputes and an increase in our effective tax rate, which could adversely affect our financial results. The integrated nature of our worldwide operations can produce conflicting claims from tax authorities in different countries as to the profits to be taxed in the individual countries, including potential disputes relating to the prices our subsidiaries charge one another for intercompany transactions, known as transfer pricing. Most of the jurisdictions in which we operate have double tax treaties with other foreign jurisdictions, which provide a framework for mitigating the impact of double taxation on our revenues and capital gains. However, mechanisms developed to resolve such conflicting claims are largely untried and can be expected to be very lengthy. Accruals for tax contingencies are made based on experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities. However, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payments materially different from the amounts accrued.

In 2019, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched a new initiative on behalf of the G20 to minimize profit shifting by working toward a global tax framework that ensures that corporate income taxes are paid where consumption takes place, in addition to introducing a global standard on minimum taxation combined with new tax dispute resolution processes. This project achieved OECD political consensus in October 2021, and the detailed principles are
still under discussion by the OECD and political leaders. The implementation of certain of these new OECD principles began in 2024 in certain countries, including Switzerland. However, some countries already announced postponement to 2025 while others have not taken any implementation steps so far. Once changes to the tax laws in any jurisdiction in which we operate are enacted or substantially enacted, we will be subject to the OECD minimum tax regime, the aim of which is to bring the total amount of taxes paid on our profit in a given jurisdiction up to a minimum rate of $15 \%$. In June 2023, the Swiss public voted to approve an amendment to the Swiss Constitution that provides the legal basis for the implementation of an OECD compliant minimum tax in Switzerland. In December 2023, the Swiss Federal Council partially implemented the OECD 15\% minimum tax for the financial year 2024 in the form of a qualified domestic top-up tax (QDMTT), which will be assessed on certain qualifying profits earned by companies domiciled in Switzerland. This QDMTT will not be applied to qualifying profits earned by a company's affiliates domiciled in tax jurisdictions outside of Switzerland. In September 2024, the Swiss Federal Council announced implementation of the income inclusion rule in 2025 as a next step to further align with the new OECD global agreed standards. The timing and specific provisions of any further tax regulations remain subject to assessments in political and technical forums at both a federal and cantonal level.

Due to the ongoing discussion in many countries on the implementation and additional guidance from the OECD, the full impact of the OECD minimum tax project on our financial position, income statement and cash flows in the longer term cannot currently be estimated as the OECD continues to issue additional guidance aimed at providing more clarity on the application of the new global standards.

On September 12, 2023, the EU Commission published two draft directives relating to international tax. The draft Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation (BEFIT) directive provides common rules for determining the corporate tax base for EU-based entities that are part of a group with global consolidated revenues above EUR 750 million. The BEFIT proposal includes provisions for a formula-driven allocation of profits between relevant EU member states which would then be subject to the corporate income tax rate of the respective member state. The draft transfer pricing directive aims to harmonize transfer pricing rules within the EU consistent with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. It also clarifies processes for relieving double taxation within the EU. Both draft directives require unanimous agreement among EU member states before they can be further implemented. In the US, the IRA was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The IRA creates a 15\% corporate alternative minimum tax on the profits of corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeds USD 1.0 billion. The IRA also includes a one percent excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases. Additionally, the IRA also contains provisions that affect tax-exempt entities, including tax credit opportunities to encourage investment in clean energy and expanded incentives for energy-efficient construction by tax-exempt entities.

While we have taken steps to comply with the evolving tax initiatives of the OECD, the US and the EU, and we will continue to do so, significant uncertainties remain as to the outcome of our efforts.

## General risks

## Indebtedness

## Risk description

Our indebtedness could adversely affect our operations

## Context and potential impact

As of December 31, 2024, we had USD 21.4 billion of non-current financial debt, and USD 8.2 billion of current financial debt. Our current and long-term debt requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to service interest and principal payments and, if interest rates rise, this amount may increase. As a result, our existing debt may limit our ability to use our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, to engage in transactions, or to meet other capital needs, or otherwise may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt. Our debt could also limit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business or industry, and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates or a downturn in our business or the economy. We may also have difficulty refinancing our existing debt or incurring new debt on terms that we would consider to be commercially reasonable, if at all.

## Goodwill and intangible assets

## Risk description

Goodwill and intangible assets resulting in significant impairment charges

## Context and potential impact

We carry a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet, including, in particular, substantial goodwill and other intangible assets obtained through acquisitions, including most recently through our acquisitions of Chinook Therapeutics, MorphoSys AG, Mariana Oncology and Kate Therapeutics. As a result, we have incurred, and may in the future incur further, significant impairment charges if the fair value of the intangible assets and the groupings of cash-generating units containing goodwill would be less than their carrying value on our consolidated balance sheet at any point in time.

We regularly review our intangible and tangible assets for impairment, including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. If one or more events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, such revision could result in an impairment
charge in the period in which it occurs. Any significant impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In 2024, for example, we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of USD 1.4 billion.

For a detailed discussion about how we determine whether an impairment has occurred, what factors could result in an impairment, and the impact of impairment charges on our results of operations, see Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Accounting policies" and "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 11. Goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill."

## Foreign currency exchange rates

## Risk description

Negative effect on financial results due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations

## Context and potential impact

Changes in exchange rates between the US dollar, which is our reporting currency, and other currencies has previously resulted in, and in the future may result in significant increases or decreases in our reported sales, costs and earnings as expressed in US dollars, and in the reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows.

In addition to ordinary market risk, there is a risk that countries could take affirmative steps that could significantly impact the value of their currencies. Such steps could include unconventional monetary policies, tariffs and potential withdrawals by countries from common currencies. In addition, countries facing local financial difficulties, including countries experiencing high inflation rates, and highly indebted countries facing large capital outflows, may impose controls on the exchange of foreign currency. Currency exchange controls and sanctions could limit our ability to distribute retained earnings from our local affiliates, or to pay intercompany payables due from those countries.

Despite measures undertaken to reduce or hedge against foreign currency exchange risks, as a significant portion of our earnings and expenditures are in currencies other than the US dollar, including expenditures in Swiss francs that are significantly higher than our revenue in Swiss francs, any such exchange rate volatility may negatively and materially impact our results of operations and financial condition, and may impact the reported value of our net sales, earnings, assets and liabilities. In addition, the timing and extent of such volatility can be difficult to predict. Furthermore, depending on the movements of particular foreign exchange rates, we may be materially adversely affected at a time when the same currency movements are benefiting some of our competitors.

For more information on the effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated financial statements and on how we manage currency risk, see "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Item 5.B Liquidity and capital resources-Effects of currency fluctuations" and "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 28. Financial instruments - additional disclosures."

## Key customers

## Risk description

Concentration among our key customers

## Context and potential impact

A significant portion of our global sales is made to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers, retail chains and other purchasing organizations. For example, our three most important customers globally accounted for approximately $17 \%, 13 \%$ and $7 \%$, respectively, of net sales from continuing operations in 2024. The largest trade receivables outstanding were for these three customers, amounting to $19 \%, 12 \%$ and $7 \%$, respectively, of the trade receivables at December 31, 2024. Historically, there has been a trend of consolidation among our customer base, which may continue in the future. As a result, we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk among our key customers. If one or more of our major customers experienced financial difficulties, the effect on us would be considerable, and could include a substantial loss of sales and an inability to collect amounts owed to us.

## Environmental matters

## Risk description

Impact of environmental liabilities

## Context and potential impact

The environmental laws of various jurisdictions impose actual and potential obligations on us to investigate and remediate contaminated sites, including in connection with activities in the past by businesses that are no longer part of Novartis. In some cases, these remediation efforts may take many years. While we have set aside provisions for known worldwide environmental liabilities that are probable and estimable, there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts for which we have provided in our consolidated financial statements. If environmental contamination resulting from our facility operations, business activities or products adversely impacts third parties or if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facilities, including the safety of our employees and contractors, and the environmental risks, we may face substantial one-time and recurring costs and other penalties, and be required to increase our provisions for environmental liabilities.

Furthermore, our headquarters and a number of our major production and research facilities are located near earthquake fault lines in Basel, Switzerland. Other major facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines in various locations around the world. A major earthquake could result in loss of life, business interruptions and the destruction of our facilities. See also "Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.D Property, plants and equipment" and "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 20. Provisions and other non-current liabilities."

## Pension plans

## Risk description

Inaccuracies in the assumptions and estimates used to calculate our pension plan and other post-employment obligations

## Context and potential impact

We sponsor pension and other post-employment benefit plans in various forms that cover a significant portion of our current and former employees. For post-employment plans with defined benefit obligations, we are required to make significant assumptions and estimates about future events in calculating the expense and the present value of the liability related to these plans. These include assumptions about the discount rates we apply to estimate future defined benefit obligations and net periodic pension expense, as well as rates of future pension increases. In addition, our actuarial consultants provide our management with historical statistical information, such as withdrawal and mortality rates in connection with these estimates.

Assumptions and estimates that we use may differ materially from the actual results we experience due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, and longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other factors. Depending on events, such differences could have a material effect on our total equity, and may require us to make additional contributions to our pension funds.

For more information on obligations under retirement and other post-employment benefit plans and underlying actuarial assumptions, see "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 24. Post-employment benefits for employees."

## Key marketed products

The following summaries describe certain Novartis key marketed products in certain indications. These products are listed according to year-end net sales. Some of them have lost patent protection or are otherwise subject to generic competition, while others are subject to patent challenges by potential generic competitors (see "-Intellectual property" for general information on intellectual property and regulatory data protection, and for more information on the status of patents and exclusivity for certain key marketed products).

While we typically seek to sell our marketed products throughout the world, not all products and indications are available in every country. The indications described in these summaries may therefore vary by country. In addition, a product may be available under different brand names depending on country and indication.

- Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) is an oral, first-in-class angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor.

- Lucentis (ranibizumab) is a humanized, high-affinity antibody fragment that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), a protein that can cause the growth of blood vessels in the eye, potentially leading to vision loss. Lucentis is an anti-VEGF therapy that is injected into the eye. It is approved in the EU and other countries to treat patients with certain eye conditions, including:
- Adults with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Wet AMD develops when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula and leak blood and other fluids in the back of the eye, which damages the macula
- Adults with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and/or visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema. These conditions are complications of diabetes
- Adults with visual impairment due to macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or central RVO). Retinal vein occlusion is a blockage of the branch or central retinal veins, which carry blood away from the retina

Approved indications vary by country. Lucentis is licensed from Genentech, and Novartis holds the rights to commercialize the product outside the US. Genentech holds the rights to commercialize Lucentis in the US.

- Leqvio (inclisiran) is the first and only approved small-interfering RNA therapy to reduce LDL cholesterol, a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which is caused by plaque buildup in the arteries. Leqvio is administered by a healthcare professional twice a year as an injection, except in the first year of treatment where, following an initial dose, another dose is required after three months. It is approved:
- In the EU and other countries to treat adults with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunct to diet. Leqvio is used in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL cholesterol goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, or alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant or for whom a statin is contraindicated. Primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia are disorders characterized by high levels of fats (lipids) in the blood

## Compounds in development

The following table provides an overview of key projects currently in the Confirmatory Development stage and may also describe certain projects in the Early Development stage. Projects typically enter Confirmatory Development and become the responsibility of our Development organizational unit during Phase II testing. (For more information about our drug development program, see "-Research and development-Development program.") Projects are listed in alphabetical order by compound code, or by product name where applicable. Included are projects seeking to develop potential uses of new molecular entities as well as potential additional indications or new formulations for already marketed products. The table below, entitled "Projects removed from the development table since 2023," highlights changes to the table entitled "Selected development projects" from the previous year.

The year that each project entered the current phase of development refers to the year of the first patient's first visit in the first clinical trial of that phase. For projects in Phase II, the year generally refers to the first patient's first visit in the first trial in Confirmatory Development. In some cases, the first patient's first visit in a Phase II trial can occur before the Confirmatory Development stage.

A reference to a project being in registration means that an application has been submitted to a health authority for marketing approval. Compounds and new indications in development are subject to required regulatory approvals and, in certain instances, contractual limitations. These compounds and indications are in various stages of development throughout the world. It may not be possible to obtain regulatory approval for any or all of the new compounds and new indications referred to in the Form 20-F in any country or in every country. See "-Regulation" for more information on the approval process.

${ }^{1}$ Emerging growth markets comprise all markets other than the established markets of the US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Novartis definition of Western Europe includes Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

Many of our products are used for chronic conditions that require patients to continue dosing of the product over long periods of time, ranging from months to years. However, certain of our marketed products and
development projects, such as cell and gene therapies, are administered only once. Net sales of the vast majority of our products are not subject to material changes in seasonal demand.


### Page 32 ###

## Production

Our primary goal is to ensure the uninterrupted and timely supply of medicines that meet all product specifications and quality standards, and that are produced in the most cost-effective and sustainable manner. The manufacturing of our products is highly regulated by governmental health authorities around the world, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). In addition to regulatory requirements, many of our products involve technically complex manufacturing processes or require highly specialized raw materials.

We manufacture our products across the following technologies at facilities worldwide: large molecules, small molecules, cell and gene therapy, xRNA therapy and radioligand therapy (see also "-Item 4.D Property, plants and equipment"). We are continuing to integrate ADACAP manufacturing sites into our existing manufacturing and supply structure for radioligand therapies. In addition, we generate contract manufacturing sales from chemistry, biotherapeutics, xRNA and cell and gene therapy, including fill and finish activities, which we include under "established brands" in our consolidated financial statements (see "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 4. Revenues and geographic information").

In our manufacturing network, we maintain state-of-the-art processes, with quality as a priority, and require our suppliers to adhere to the same high standards we expect from our own people and processes. These processes include chemical and biological syntheses; radioisotope handling; sterile processing, including CAR-T cell processing; gene modification and delivery; and formulation and packaging. We are constantly working to improve our existing manufacturing processes, develop new and innovative technologies, and review and adapt our manufacturing network to maintain quality in our manufacturing processes and supply of products to customers and patients.

We produce raw materials for manufacturing in-house or purchase them from third-party suppliers. Where possible, we maintain multiple supply sources so that the business is not dependent on a single or limited number of suppliers. However, our ability to do so may at times be limited by regulatory or other requirements. We monitor market developments that could have an adverse effect on the supply of essential materials. Our suppliers of raw materials are required to comply with applicable regulations and Novartis quality standards.

Because the manufacturing of our products is complex and highly regulated by governmental health authorities and other regulators, uninterrupted supply cannot be guaranteed. If we or our third-party suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations, then there could be a product recall or other disruption to our production activities. We have experienced supply interruptions for our products in the past, and there can be no assurance that supply will not be interrupted again in the future. For more information on the risks related to the manufacturing of our products, see "Item 3. Key Information-Item 3.D Risk factors-Manufacturing and product qualityInability to ensure proper controls in product development and product manufacturing, and failure to comply with applicable regulations and standards." We have
implemented a global manufacturing strategy to maximize business continuity in case of such events.

## Marketing and sales

Although specific distribution patterns vary by country, Novartis generally sells its prescription drugs primarily to drug wholesalers, retailers, private health systems, government agencies, managed care providers, pharmacy benefit managers, and government-supported healthcare systems. We reach healthcare professionals and patients in many markets and across our core therapeutic areas through integrated channels including field force operations, patient support programs and Novartis-owned digital platforms.

We have 19135 full-time equivalent field force employees, as of December 31, 2024, including supervisors and administrative personnel. These trained representatives present the therapeutic benefits and risks of our products to physicians, pharmacists, hospitals, insurance groups, managed care organizations and other healthcare professionals. In the US, Novartis advertises certain products via digital and traditional media channels, including the internet, television, newspapers and magazines. Novartis also pursues co-promotion or co-marketing opportunities as well as licensing and distribution agreements with other companies in various markets.

The marketplace for healthcare is constantly evolving. Customer groups beyond prescribers have increasing influence on treatment decisions and guidelines, while patients continue to become more informed stakeholders in their healthcare decisions and look for solutions to meet their changing needs. Novartis is responding by adapting our business practices to engage appropriately with patients, customer groups and other stakeholders, including by delivering innovative solutions to drive education, access and improved patient care.

The growing number of so-called "specialty" drugs in our portfolio, such as Cosentyx and Kesimpta, has resulted in increased engagement with specialty pharmacies. Because many of these drugs require special handling and administration, we are rolling out patient support programs across our priority markets that serve as a central resource for onboarding, education and support to help patients navigate their healthcare.

In the US, the US Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services (CMS) is the largest single payer for healthcare services as a result of continuing changes in healthcare economics and an aging population. In addition, both commercial and government-sponsored managed care organizations continue to be among the largest groups of payers for healthcare services in the US. In other countries, national health services are often the only significant payer for healthcare services. In an effort to control prescription drug costs, almost all managed care organizations and national health services use formularies that list specific drugs that may be reimbursed and/or the level of reimbursement for each drug. Managed care organizations and national health services also use cost-benefit analyses to determine whether or not newly approved drugs will be added to a formulary and/or the level of reimbursement for that drug, and to determine whether or not to continue to reimburse existing drugs.


### Page 33 ###

We have dedicated teams that actively seek to optimize patient access, including formulary positions, for our products.

The trend toward consolidation among distributors and retailers of our products continues in the US and internationally, both within and across countries. This has increased our customers' purchasing leverage and resulted in increased pricing pressure on our products. Moreover, we are exposed to increased concentration of credit risk as a result of the consolidation among our customers.

Drug pricing is an increasingly prominent issue in many countries as healthcare spending continues to rise. This issue has received significant attention in the US, especially with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (see "-Price controls" for more information). At Novartis, we aim to enable patient access through innovative pricing and access initiatives in the US, Europe and other markets. These include contract structures such as pay-over-time and outcome-based agreements.

## Competition

The global pharmaceutical market is highly competitive. We compete against other major international corporations that have substantial financial and other resources, as well as against smaller companies that operate regionally or nationally. Competition within the industry is intense and extends across a wide range of activities, including pricing, product characteristics, customer service, sales and marketing, and research and development.

Like other companies selling patented pharmaceuticals, Novartis faces challenges from companies selling competing patented products. Generic forms of our products may follow the expiration of intellectual property protection or regulatory exclusivities, and generic companies may also gain entry to the market through successfully challenging our intellectual property rights and exclusivities. We use appropriate, legally permissible measures to defend those rights and exclusivities (see also "-Intellectual property" below).

There is ongoing consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry. At the same time, new entrants are looking to use their expertise to establish or expand their presence in healthcare. Technology companies, for instance, are seeking to benefit from the increasing importance of data and data management in our industry, including the use of artificial intelligence.

## Research and development

The discovery and development of a new drug usually requires approximately 10 to 15 years from the initial research to bringing a drug to market. This includes approximately six to eight years from Phase I clinical trials to market entry. At each of these steps, there is a substantial risk that a therapeutic candidate will not meet the requirements to progress further. In such an event, we may be required to abandon the development of a
potential therapy in which we have made a substantial investment.

We manage our research and development expenditures across our entire portfolio in accordance with our strategic priorities. We make decisions about whether or not to proceed with development projects on a proj-ect-by-project basis. These decisions are based on the project's potential to meet a significant unmet medical need or to improve patient outcomes, the strength of the science underlying the project, and the potential of the project (subject to the risks inherent in pharmaceutical development) to generate significant positive financial results for the Company. Once a management decision has been made to proceed with the development of a therapeutic candidate, the level of research and development investment required will be driven by many factors. These include the medical indications for which it is being developed, the number, sequence and timing of indications being pursued, whether the therapeutic candidate is of a chemical or biological nature, the stage of development, and the level of evidence necessary to demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety.

## Research program

Our research and early development program is conducted by our Biomedical Research organizational unit, which is the innovation engine of Novartis. This unit is responsible for the discovery and first clinical evaluation of new medicines that bring value for patients and the Company. This requires hiring and retaining highly talented employees, focusing on fundamental disease mechanisms that are relevant across different disease areas, continuously improving technologies for drug discovery and potential therapies, working with patients to understand their diseases and the potential benefits of therapies, forming close alliances with clinical and commercial colleagues, and establishing strategic external alliances.

We have 5582 full-time-equivalent scientists, physicians and business professionals at Biomedical Research sites in Basel, Switzerland; Cambridge, Massachusetts; East Hanover, New Jersey; San Diego, California; and Emeryville, California. They contribute to research in our core therapeutic areas of cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases; neuroscience; oncology; and immunology, among others. Research at the Friedrich Miescher Institute focuses on basic genetic and genomic research, and our Global Health Disease Area (formerly the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases) focuses on discovering new medicines to fight tropical diseases, including malaria and cryptosporidiosis.

All drug candidates go through clinical trials to enable an early assessment of the safety and efficacy of the drug while collecting basic information on how the drug moves through the body and is tolerated, and adhering to the guidance for early clinical testing set forth by health authorities. When assessments are favorable, our Development organizational unit conducts confirmatory trials on the drug candidates to generate data that can be submitted to regulatory authorities to secure approval for patient use.


### Page 34 ###

## Development program

Our Development organizational unit oversees and executes drug development activities in our core therapeutic areas, working collaboratively with Biomedical Research, our commercial units and other parts of the Company on our overall pipeline strategy. It includes centralized functions such as Regulatory Affairs, Medical Affairs and Global Clinical Operations, and has 12773 full-time equivalent employees worldwide.

The traditional model of clinical development consists of three phases:
Phase I: The first clinical trials of a new compound - generally performed in a small number of healthy human volunteers or patients (e.g., in oncology) - to assess the drug's safety profile, including the safe dosage range. These trials also determine how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted, and the duration of its action.
Phase II: Studies performed with patients who have the target disease, with the aim of continuing the Phase I safety assessment in a larger group, assessing the efficacy of the drug in the patient population, and determining the appropriate doses for further evaluation.
Phase III: Large-scale studies with up to several thousand patients, which aim to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug in specific indications for regulatory approval. Phase III trials may also be used to compare a new drug against a current standard of care to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the new medicine.

In each of these phases, physicians monitor consenting volunteers or patients closely to assess the safety and efficacy of a potential new drug or indication.

Although we use this traditional model, we take a flexible and efficient approach based on close collaboration across R\&D, enabling Development teams to initiate lat-er-stage planning in parallel with early evaluations and research teams to better support later-stage activities.

Our development process consists of two stages: Early Development to build confidence in the overall properties of the compound, followed by Confirmatory Development to confirm the concept in large numbers of patients. Early development consists of both Phase I studies in healthy volunteers as well as Phase Ib and Phase II studies in patients. This work includes a careful review of safety and tolerability, understanding of whether the drug is modulating the target of interest, and understanding of dose response and early evidence of disease efficacy. Biomedical Research conducts these trials and if this evaluation is positive, the drug moves to the Confirmatory Development stage and becomes the responsibility of Development.

Confirmatory Development has elements of traditional Phase II/III testing and includes trials aimed at confirming the safety and efficacy of the drug in the given indication, leading up to submission of a dossier to health authorities for approval. This stage can also include trials that compare the drug to the current standard of care for the disease in order to evaluate the drug's overall ben-efit-risk profile. Further, with new treatment approaches such as gene therapy for rare diseases, elements of Early and Confirmatory Development may be combined and suffice for registration under certain conditions such as
high unmet medical need and clinical data showing highly favorable benefit-risk profiles. In these cases, additional post-approval studies may be required by the regulatory authorities to continue to gather important data to further support approval.

The vast amount of data that must be collected and evaluated makes clinical testing the most time-consuming and expensive part of new drug development. The next stage in the drug development process is to seek registration for the new drug. For more information, see "—Regulation."

The Innovation Management Board (IMB), chaired by our Chief Executive Officer, drives our R\&D portfolio strategy. The IMB endorses new early- and late-stage development projects, strategic plans and portfolio-related priorities. It oversees our drug development budget; approves major project phase transitions; and makes key decisions, such as when to submit regulatory applications to health authorities or when to discontinue projects. IMB members include representatives from the Executive Committee of Novartis (ECN) and senior management with expertise in different fields.

To support our R\&D strategy, we are investing in AI and other technologies that have the potential to enhance and accelerate the delivery of innovative medicines to patients. We are working with partners on scalable projects in early-stage research and in clinical development to help improve our decision-making and generate actionable insights across our core therapeutic areasfrom designing new compounds to predicting drug safety and conducting clinical trials. In addition, we are continuously adapting our organizational setup to drive a leading and sustainable R\&D performance, by building future capabilities across our Development organization and accessing global talent pools.

## Alliances and acquisitions

Novartis enters into business development agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and with academic and other institutions to develop new products and access new markets. We license products that complement our current product line and are appropriate to our business strategy. We focus on strategic alliances and acquisition activities for key disease areas and indications that we expect to be growth drivers in the future. We review products and compounds we are considering licensing, using the same criteria that we use for our own internally discovered drugs.

In May 2024, Novartis acquired Mariana Oncology, a US based, preclinical biotechnology company focused on developing novel radioligand therapies across a range of solid tumors. The acquisition brings a robust portfolio of RLT programs, including MC-339, an actinium-based RLT being investigated in small cell lung cancer.

In May 2024, Novartis acquired an $89.7 \%$ interest in MorphoSys AG, a German based biopharmaceuticals company, which owns the following assets: pelabresib (late-stage BET inhibitor for myelofibrosis) and tulmimetostat (early-stage dual EZH2 and EZH1 inhibitor for solid tumors or lymphomas). In October 2024, Novartis completed the acquisition of the remaining outstanding

## Regulation

The international pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated. Regulatory authorities around the world administer numerous laws and regulations regarding the testing, approval, manufacturing, importing, labeling and marketing of drugs, and review the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products. Extensive controls exist on the non-clinical and clinical development of pharmaceutical products. These regulatory requirements, and the implementation of them by local health authorities around the globe, are a major factor in determining whether a substance can be developed into a marketable product, and the amount of time and expense associated with that development.

Health authorities, including those in the US and the EU, have high standards of technical evaluation. The introduction of new pharmaceutical products generally entails a lengthy approval process. Products must be authorized or registered prior to marketing, and such authorization or registration must subsequently be maintained. In recent years, the registration process has required increased testing and documentation for the approval of new drugs, with a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction.

To register a pharmaceutical product, a registration dossier containing evidence establishing the safety, efficacy and quality of the product must be submitted to regulatory authorities. Generally, a therapeutic product must be registered in each country in which it will be sold. In every country, the submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that approval to market the product will be granted. Although the criteria for the registration of therapeutic drugs are similar in most countries, the formal structure of the necessary registration documents and the specific requirements, including risk tolerance, of the local health authorities can vary significantly from country to country. Even if a drug is registered and marketed in one country, the registration authority in another country may request additional information from the pharmaceutical company prior to registration or even reject the product. A drug may be approved for different indications in different countries.

The registration process generally takes between six months and several years, depending on the country, the quality of the data submitted, the efficiency of the registration authority's procedures, and the nature of the product. Many countries provide for accelerated processing of registration applications for innovative
products of particular therapeutic interest. In recent years, the US and the EU have made efforts to harmonize registration requirements in order to achieve shorter development and registration times for medical products. However, the requirement in many countries to negotiate selling prices or reimbursement levels with government regulators and other payers can substantially extend the time until a product may finally be available to patients.

The following provides a summary of the regulatory processes in the principal markets served by our affiliates:

## United States

In the US, applications for drug registration are submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. The FDA regulates the testing, manufacturing, labeling and approval for marketing of pharmaceutical products intended for commercialization in the US. The FDA continues to monitor the safety of pharmaceutical products after they have been approved for sale in the US market. The pharmaceutical development and registration process is typically intensive, lengthy and rigorous. When a pharmaceutical company has gathered data that it believes sufficiently demonstrates a drug's safety, efficacy and quality, the company may file a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA), as applicable, for the compound. The NDA or BLA must contain all the scientific information that has been gathered about the compound. This typically includes information regarding the clinical experiences of patients tested in the drug's clinical trials. A Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) or Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) must be filed for new indications and dosage forms for a previously approved drug.

Once an application is submitted, the FDA assigns reviewers from its staff, including experts in biopharmaceutics, chemistry, clinical microbiology, pharmacology/ toxicology, and statistics. After a complete review, these content experts provide written evaluations of the NDA or BLA. These recommendations are consolidated and are used by senior FDA staff in its final evaluation of the NDA or BLA. Based on that final evaluation, the FDA then either approves the NDA or BLA, or provides a "complete response" letter if the NDA or BLA application is not approved. If not approved, the letter will state the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA that need to be addressed. The company making the application must then submit an adequate response to the deficiencies in order to restart the review procedure.

Once the FDA has approved an NDA, BLA, sNDA or sBLA, the company can make the new drug available for physicians and other healthcare providers to prescribe. The drug owner must submit periodic reports to the FDA, including any cases of adverse reactions. For some medications, the FDA requires additional post-approval studies (Phase IV) to evaluate long-term effects or to gather information on the use of the product under specified conditions.

Throughout the life cycle of a product, the FDA requires compliance with standards relating to good laboratory, clinical and manufacturing practices. The FDA also requires compliance with rules pertaining to the manner in which we may promote our products.

## European Union

In the EU, there are three main procedures for application for authorization to market pharmaceutical products in more than one EU member state at the same time: the centralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure and the decentralized procedure. It is also possible to obtain a national authorization for products intended for commercialization in a single EU member state only. The procedure used for first authorization must continue to be followed for subsequent changes, e.g., to add an indication for a licensed product.

Under the centralized procedure, applications are made to the EMA for an authorization that is valid for the European Union (all member states). The centralized procedure is mandatory for all biotechnology products; new chemical entities in cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, AIDS, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; advanced therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tis-sue-engineered medicines; and orphan medicines (medicines for rare diseases). It is optional for other new chemical entities, innovative medicinal products, and medicines for which authorization would be in the interest of public health. When a pharmaceutical company has gathered data that it believes sufficiently demonstrates a drug's safety, efficacy and quality, the company may submit an application to the EMA. The EMA then receives and validates the application, and the specialized committee for human medicines, the CHMP, appoints a rapporteur and co-rapporteur to review it. They use experts from their countries to carry out the assessment but can also draw on expertise from other member states ("multinational teams"). The entire review cycle must be completed within 210 days, although there are "clock stops" to allow the company to respond to questions set forth in the rapporteur and co-rapporteur's assessment report and agreed with the CHMP. The first clock stop is at Day 120 and the clock restarts on Day 121, when the company's complete response is received by the EMA. If there are further aspects of the dossier requiring clarification, the CHMP will issue further questions at Day 180, and may also request an oral explanation, in which case the sponsor must not only respond to the further questions but also appear before the committee to justify its responses. On Day 210, the CHMP will take a vote to recommend the approval or non-approval of the application, and their opinion is transferred to the European Commission (EC). The final EC decision under this centralized procedure is a single decision that is applicable to all member states. This decision occurs 60 days, on average, after a positive CHMP recommendation.

Under both the mutual recognition procedure (MRP) and the decentralized procedure (DCP), the assessment is led by one member state, called the reference member state (RMS), which then liaises with other member states, known as the concerned member states. In the MRP, the company first obtains a marketing authorization in the RMS, which is then recognized by the concerned member states within 90 days. In the DCP, the application is done simultaneously in the RMS and all concerned member states. During the DCP, the RMS drafts an assessment report within 120 days. Within an additional 90 days, the concerned member states review the application and can issue objections or requests for
additional information. On Day 90, each concerned member state must be assured that the product is safe and effective, and that it will cause no undue risks to the public health. Once an agreement has been reached, each member state grants national marketing authorizations for the product.

After receiving the marketing authorizations, the company must submit periodic safety reports to the relevant health authority (EMA for the centralized procedure, national health authorities for DCP or MRP). In addition, pharmacovigilance measures must be implemented and monitored, including the collection, evaluation and expedited reporting of adverse events, and updates to risk management plans. For some medications, post-approval studies (Phase IV) may be imposed to complement available data with additional data to evaluate longterm effects (called a Post-Approval Safety Study, or PASS) or to gather additional efficacy data (called a Post-Approval Efficacy Study, or PAES).

European marketing authorizations have an initial duration of five years. The holder of the marketing authorization must actively apply for its renewal after this first five-year period. As part of the renewal procedure, the competent authority performs a full benefit-risk review of the product. Should the authority conclude that the benefit-risk balance is no longer positive, the marketing authorization can be suspended or revoked. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless it is determined that the product must be further monitored for safety reasons. In this case, the authority may require another renewal at 10 years. If the holder does not apply for renewal, the marketing authorization automatically lapses. Any marketing authorization that is not followed within three years of its granting by the actual placing on the market of the corresponding medicinal product ceases to be valid.

## Price controls

In most of the markets where we operate, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to both direct and indirect price controls and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. Due to increasing political pressure and governmental budget constraints, we expect these mechanisms to remain robust - and potentially even be strengthened - and to have a continued negative influence on the prices we are able to charge for our products.

## Direct governmental efforts to control prices

United States: The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), signed into law in August 2022, mandates that eligible Medicare Part B and Part D drugs participate in what the statute calls the Drug Price Negotiation Program (Program), redesigned the Medicare Part D benefit, including a USD 2000 out-of-pocket cap for Medicare beneficiaries going into effect in 2025; and imposed penalties for Medicare drugs that increase in price faster than the rate of inflation. Under the Program, the US government will set Medicare prices for selected products it has defined as single-sourced small-molecule drugs that have been on the market for seven years following FDA approval as well as single-sourced biologics that have


### Page 37 ###

been on the market for 11 years after FDA approval, and will become effective for selected drugs two years later (nine years after FDA approval for eligible small molecules and 13 years after FDA approval for eligible biologics).

Medicare drugs with the highest total cost to the US government are selected for the Program as they become eligible. Exemptions include orphan drugs with a designation for one rare disease or condition, drugs with a total cost to Medicare of less than USD 200 million, and plasma-derived drugs.

The IRA will be implemented as follows:

- 10 eligible Medicare Part D drugs in 2026
- An additional 15 eligible Medicare Part D drugs in 2027
- An additional 15 eligible combined Medicare Part B and Part D drugs in 2028
- An additional 20 eligible combined Medicare Part B and Part D drugs in 2029
- An additional 20 eligible combined Medicare Part B and Part D drugs each year after 2029

On August 29, 2023, the US government released the list of the first 10 drugs to be subject to the Program, and Entresto was one of the selected products. Novartis has completed the process of participating because manufacturers that refuse to participate are subject to an excise tax of up to $95 \%$ of sales. Novartis has filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the US Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services because we believe the IRA's drug price-setting provisions are unconstitutional and will have long-lasting negative consequences for patients by limiting access to medicines now and in the future (for more information, see "Item 18. Financial StatementsNote 20. Provisions and other non-current liabilities"). We also expect to be affected by other provisions of the IRA, such as price increase penalties for Medicare drugs, and new mandatory rebates on eligible Medicare Part D sales.

In addition, as of December 31, 2024, 24 US states had passed legislation intended to impact pricing or requiring manufacturers to report price increases to states, with eight of these states also allowing for drug affordability (i.e., price control) review boards. The disclosure requirements vary by state. Many states require multiple types of reporting, including for new drug applications, new drug launches, prior notice of price increases, and quarterly or annual reporting.

Europe: In Europe, our operations are subject to significant price and marketing regulations. Many governments are introducing healthcare reforms in a further attempt to curb increasing healthcare costs. In some member states, these include reforms to permit the reimbursed use of off-label medicines, despite the presence of licensed alternatives on the market. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to patients. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general in the EU, particularly with regard to prescription drugs, is intense. Increasingly strict analyses are applied when evaluating the entry of new products, and as a result, access to innovative medicines is limited based on strict
cost-benefit assessments. In addition, prices for marketed products are referenced within member states and across international borders, further impacting individual EU member state pricing. Member states also collaborate to enhance pricing transparency and have started conducting joint health technology assessments, joint pricing negotiations and/or joint purchasing. As an additional control for healthcare budgets, some EU countries have passed legislation to impose further mandatory rebates for pharmaceutical products and/or financial claw-backs on the pharmaceutical industry. The calculation of these rebates and claw-backs may lack transparency in some cases and can be difficult to predict.

## Regulations favoring generics and biosimilars

In response to rising healthcare costs, most governments and private medical care providers have established reimbursement schemes that favor the substitution of more expensive brand-name pharmaceuticals by generic pharmaceuticals. All US states have generic substitution statutes. These statutes permit or require the dispensing pharmacist to substitute a less expensive generic drug instead of an original drug. Other countries, including many European countries, have similar laws. We expect that the pressure for generic substitution will continue to increase. In addition, the US, the EU and other jurisdictions are increasingly introducing laws and regulations encouraging the development of biosimilar versions of biologic drugs, which can also be expected to have an impact on pricing.

## Cross-border sales

Price controls in one country can have an impact in other countries as a result of cross-border sales. In the EU, products that we have sold to customers in countries with stringent price controls can be legally resold to customers in other EU countries at a lower price than the price at which the product is otherwise available in the importing country (known as parallel trade). In North America, products that we have sold to customers in Canada - which has relatively stringent price controls are sometimes resold into the US, again at a lower price than the price at which the product is otherwise sold in the US. Reimportation from Canada and other countries into the US for commercial purposes is currently illegal. An exception is that states may seek approval from the Secretary of HHS to establish a Canadian drug importation program. Seven US states (Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and Vermont) have enacted laws authorizing the establishment of such a program. However, the Secretary of the HHS must approve each state importation plan before it can be implemented. As of December 31, 2024, Florida is the only state to receive FDA approval for a state importation plan, but has not yet implemented it.

We expect that pressures on pricing will continue worldwide and will likely increase. Because of these pressures, there can be no certainty that in every instance we will be able to charge prices for a product that, in a particular country or in the aggregate, would enable us to earn an adequate return on our investment in that product.

## Intellectual property

Intellectual property (IP) rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, and trade secrets, as well as regulatory-based protections, are essential to our business as an innovative medicines company and protect our innovation and investments in research and development, manufacturing, and marketing of our products.

## Patents

Patents may cover a product itself, including the product's active ingredient or other ingredients and its formulation. Patents may also cover processes for manufacturing a product, including processes for manufacturing intermediate substances used in the manufacture of the product. In addition, patents may cover particular uses of a product, such as its use to treat a particular disease, or its dosage regimen. Further, patents may cover tests for certain diseases or biomarkers - which can improve patient outcomes when administered with certain drugs - as well as assays, research tools, and other techniques used to identify new drugs.

## United States

- In the US, an issued patent will generally receive a term of 20 years from the earliest application filing date and may be eligible for potential patent term adjustments if there are delays in prosecution of the patent by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
- A US pharmaceutical patent may also be eligible for a patent term extension (PTE) given that the development of a pharmaceutical product and its review by the FDA can take an extended period of time. PTE provides an extension of patent term to compensate for the time taken to conduct clinical trials and for the FDA's review process. The PTE may only extend the patent term for a maximum of five years and may not extend the patent term beyond 14 years from regulatory approval. For a patent to be eligible for PTE, the patent must claim the product, a method of using the product, or a method of manufacturing the product. In addition, only one patent may be extended for any product.


## European Union

- Patent applications in Europe may be filed in the European Patent Office (EPO) or in the patent offices of particular countries. The term of a patent granted by the EPO or an EU country's patent office is 20 years from the earliest application filing date. A patent issued by the EPO may also become a Unitary Patent, enforceable in multiple countries in the EU.
- Given that the development of a pharmaceutical product and its review by health authorities in the EU can take an extended period of time, a pharmaceutical patent in the EU may be eligible for a patent term extension that is called a supplementary protection certificate (SPC). An SPC may only extend the term of a patent for a maximum of five years, and may not extend the term of the patent beyond 15 years from the date of the first EU marketing authorization for the product covered by the patent. There is no unified procedure among countries in the EU for obtaining an SPC and SPCs must be applied for and granted on a coun-try-by-country basis.

Whether we are granted PTEs or SPCs, and the duration thereof, may depend upon many factors, including whether we have exercised due diligence during the product testing phase or regulatory review process, have applied for the extension within applicable deadlines, and satisfied all other applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request.

## RDP and market exclusivity

In addition to patent protection, various countries provide regulatory-based protection, including regulatory data protection (RDP) and/or other market exclusivities, for a prescribed period of time. RDP provides exclusivity that precludes a potential competitor from filing a regulatory application that relies on the sponsor's clinical trial data, or that precludes the regulatory authority from approving the application for a set period of time.

## United States

- A new small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient receives five years of RDP, during which time a competitor generally may not obtain final approval of an application to the FDA based on a sponsor's clinical data.
- A new biologic active pharmaceutical ingredient receives 12 years of regulatory-based market exclusivity, during which time a competitor generally may not market the same or similar drug.
- The FDA may also request that a sponsor conduct pediatric studies and, in exchange, it will grant an additional six-month period of pediatric market exclusivity if the sponsor makes a timely submission of the reports of the pediatric studies in response to the FDA's written request. The sponsor must also have a patent-based and/or regulatory-based exclusivity period for the product to which the pediatric market exclusivity is appended.
- Orphan drug exclusivity (ODE) provides seven years of market exclusivity for drugs designated by the FDA as orphan drugs, meaning drugs that treat rare diseases affecting fewer than 200000 people in the US. During this period, a potential competitor generally may not market the same or similar drug for the same indication even if the competitor's application does not rely on data from the sponsor.


## European Union

- A new pharmaceutical ingredient receives eight years of data protection, during which a competitor cannot rely on the relevant data; a further period of two years of market exclusivity, during which the data can be used to support applications for marketing authorization but a competitive product cannot be launched; and a possible one-year extension of the market exclusivity period if, during the initial eight-year data exclusivity period, the sponsor registered a new therapeutic indication with "significant clinical benefit."
- ODE provides for 10 years of market exclusivity, during which time an application for the same or similar medicine for the same indication will not generally be accepted or granted. Under certain circumstances, this exclusivity can be extended with a two-year pediatric extension.


### Page 39 ###

## Third-party patents and challenges to intellectual property

Third parties can challenge our IP, including patents, PTEs, SPCs, RDP, and marketing exclusivities (such as pediatric extensions and ODE), through various proceedings. For example, patents in the US can be challenged in the USPTO through various proceedings, including inter partes review (IPR) and post-grant review (PGR) proceedings. They may also be challenged through patent infringement litigation under the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act or under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). In the EU, patents may be challenged through oppositions in the EPO, revocation actions before the Unified Patent Court, or national patents may be challenged in national courts or national patent offices. The outcomes of such challenges can be difficult to predict.

In addition to directly challenging our IP rights, in some circumstances a competitor may be able to market a generic version of one of our products by, for example, designing around our patents or marketing the generic product for non-patent-protected indications, or filing a separate New Drug Application (NDA) under the Hatch-Waxman Act (typically referred to as a 505(b)(2) application). Despite RDP, a competitor could opt to incur the costs of conducting its own clinical trials and preparing its own regulatory application and avoid our RDP altogether. There is a risk that some countries may seek to impose limitations on or seek not to recognize the availability of IP rights for pharmaceutical products, or limit the extent to which such rights may be enforced. Additionally, even though we may own, co-own or in-license patents protecting our products, and conduct free-dom-to-operate analyses, a third party may nevertheless assert that one of our products infringes or otherwise violates a third-party patent or other intellectual property right for which we do not have a license, seeking remedies such as monetary damages or an injunction against our continued marketing of the product.

As a result, there can be no assurance that our IP rights will protect our products or that we will be able to avoid adverse effects from the loss of IP protection or from third-party patents or other intellectual property rights in the future. For more information on the risks related to IP, see "Item 3. Key Information-Item 3.D Risk factors-Intellectual property-Expiry, assertion or loss of intellectual property protection."

## Intellectual property protection for certain key marketed products and compounds in development

The following chart lists our key marketed products together with the year in which, unless otherwise indicated, the basic composition of matter (CoM) patent protection (including granted PTEs, granted SPCs, and granted pediatric exclusivity periods) or regulatory exclusivity (for example, RDP or ODE), whichever lasts longer, is currently estimated to expire in the US and EU. We also sell these products in other countries, but do not include exclusivity loss on a country-by-country basis, which may vary considerably from the estimated loss in the US and EU. Generally, the dates in the table below for each of the products are estimated only for the purpose of business or financial planning. Moreover, where applicable, we provide information regarding current challenges involving the patents or regulatory exclusivities expiring on the listed dates. In addition, we may own, co-own, control, or have rights to additional, later-expiring patents relating, for example, to compound forms, methods of treatment or use, formulations, devices, processes, product-by-process, synthesis, purification, and assays. We may also be seeking or may have been granted forms of regulatory exclusivity that may expire later than the dates shown below. These later-expiring patents or RDP may or may not protect our products from generic or biosimilar competition after the date specified.

It is not possible to predict with certainty the length of patent or regulatory-based market exclusivity for any of our products because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity and inherent uncertainties regarding IP litigation. There can be no assurance that a particular product will receive patent or regulatory-based market exclusivity for the full period of time that we estimate, or at all, and the products listed below may face generic or biosimilar competition in the US or EU earlier than the dates listed below. See "Item 3. Key Information-Item 3.D Risk factorsIntellectual property-Expiry, assertion or loss of intellectual property protection" for additional information.

## Established Brands

Lucentis faces generic competition in the EU. For Sandostatin SC, there is generic competition in the US and the EU. For Sandostatin LAR, there is generic competition in the US and in most EU countries.

## Compounds in development

We provide certain patent information for non-marketed compounds in development that have been submitted to the FDA and/or the EMA for registration but have not yet been approved by either agency. For these products, Novartis will seek all appropriate RDP, will continue to seek additional intellectual property protection for
significant product developments, and will apply for PTEs and SPCs in keeping with the great importance we attach to intellectual property.

## Trademarks

Our products are sold under brand names and logos which are generally protected as trademarks and/or through related intellectual property rights. Trademark registrations are for fixed, but renewable, terms and protection is provided, depending on the country, for as long as the trademark is registered and/or in use. Protecting our trademarks is of material importance to us

## Overview

Novartis is an innovative medicines company engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of a broad range of innovative pharmaceutical medicines. Our purpose is to reimagine medicine to improve and extend people's lives by leveraging our scientific expertise to find new ways to treat and cure disease. Our operations are organized into five organizational units: Biomedical Research, Development, Operations, and two commercial units US and International. Global functions support these organizational units in the execution of their work. We focus on four core therapeutic areas with strong growth potential and high unmet patient needs-cardiovascular, renal and metabolic; immunology; neuroscience; and oncology. For more information about our organizational structure, see "Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Overview."

Following the September 15, 2023, shareholders' approval of the spin-off of the Sandoz business, Novartis reported the Company's consolidated financial statements as "continuing" and "discontinued" operations, in compliance with IFRS Accounting Standards. For more information, see "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Accounting policies."

The disclosures and commentary in this "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects" focus on continuing operations. We also provide information on discontinued operations.

Continuing operations include the retained business activities of Novartis, comprising the innovative medicines business and continued corporate activities.

Discontinued operations include the Sandoz generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars division and certain corporate activities attributable to Sandoz prior to the spinoff up to the distribution date of October 3, 2023, and certain other expenses related to the spin-off. Included in 2023 is also the IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, non-taxable net gain on distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders. Sandoz operated in the off-patent medicines segment and specialized in the development, manufacturing, and marketing of generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars. The Sandoz business was organized globally into two franchises: Generics and Biosimilars.

Significant transactions are discussed in "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 2. Significant acquisitions of businesses and spin-off of Sandoz business," and "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 27. Commitments and contingent liabilities."

## Our business environment

Progress in science and technology raises the possibility of new types of medicines and more efficient drug discovery. At the same time, many people struggle to access healthcare, while aging populations are putting pressure on healthcare systems. The major trends currently shaping our business environment include:

- Scientific progress is opening new paths to treat disease. Rapid progress in medical science is creating opportunities for new types of treatments. These advances highlight the importance of investment in R\&D, including in next-generation technologies such as radioligand therapies and gene and cell therapies.
- Demand for high-quality healthcare continues to rise. Demand for medicines in areas such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and immunology continues to grow in key markets. The US and EU markets are expanding. China is growing rapidly, while spending in Japan is forecast to remain stable.
- Healthcare systems are under strain. In many countries, healthcare systems are under pressure. Longterm factors such as aging and lifestyle changes have led to a significant rise in noncommunicable illnesses such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease.
- The policy landscape is changing. Evolving legislation and regulations are changing how governments pay for medicines. In the US, the IRA will impose price controls on select drugs in the Medicare program. The EU is revising the legislative framework for medicines, with the aim of improving access and affordability, while China has rolled out a volume-based procurement program to reduce prices for eligible medicines. See "Item 3. Key Information-Item 3.D Risk factors-Pricing, reimbursement and access-Pricing and reimbursement pressure, including pricing transparency and


### Page 44 ###

access to healthcare," and "Item 3. Key InformationItem 3.D Risk factors-Macroeconomic develop-ments-Impact of macroeconomic developments."

- The market for healthcare is evolving. Customer groups have increasing influence on treatment decisions and guidelines, while patients continue to become more informed stakeholders in their healthcare decisions and look for solutions to meet their changing needs.
- Access to medicines remains a challenge. Many people around the world struggle to access healthcare and medicines. The issue is linked to demographic, social and economic challenges such as aging, poverty and inequality, as well as to structural issues such as limited healthcare infrastructure, shortages of trained healthcare workers, and the cost of healthcare and medicines. Improving access requires a holistic approach that acknowledges these complex factors and relies on stakeholder collaboration and partnerships.
- Al is poised to reshape the industry. Across the biopharmaceutical industry, we are beginning to realize the benefits of new technologies such as Al in automating processes and generating insights that could help us design new compounds, predict drug safety or speed up drug discovery. The extent to which companies can harness this potential will depend on their ability to aggregate and analyze large volumes of anonymized health data. See "Item 3. Key Information-Item 3.D Risk factors-Research and development-Failure to competitively discover and develop innovative medicines in our core therapeutic areas and leveraging our technology platforms."
- Healthcare systems aim to build climate resilience. Healthcare systems are aiming to build climate resilience, with 45 countries committing to net-zero carbon emissions in their health systems, according to the WHO. At the same time, climate change and nature loss continue to have adverse effects on human health, mainly from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress, with respiratory illnesses also on the rise due to air pollution. See "Item 3. Key Information-Item 3.D Risk factors-Climate change-Failure to manage physical and transition risks from climate change."


## Our strategy

We focus on four core therapeutic areas with strong growth potential and high unmet patient needs: cardiovascular, renal and metabolic; immunology; neuroscience; and oncology. This focus enables us to build depth in these therapeutic areas, leveraging our scientific expertise to find new ways to treat and cure disease, intervene earlier in disease pathophysiology, and improve quality of life for patients. We focus our exploratory research work in these core therapeutic areas, but also look beyond them, recognizing that cultivating a robust pipeline and remaining on the leading edge of scientific discovery requires a slightly wider aperture in early research.

We are investing in technology platforms that we expect will deliver future high-value medicines. We focus on two established platforms (chemistry and biotherapeutics) plus three advanced platforms (radioligand therapy (RLT), xRNA, and gene and cell therapy) that will play an important role in delivering transformative new medicines.

We focus on priority markets-US, Germany, China and Japan-which together account for most of the expected growth in global healthcare spending over the next five years. Although these are our priority markets, we maintain a strong presence in other markets worldwide.

To support our focus areas, we have three strategic priorities:

- Deliver high-value medicines to accelerate growth. We aim to increase growth, driven by continued strong momentum in our existing portfolio of medicinesincluding Entresto, Cosentyx, Kisqali, Kesimpta, Scemblix, Pluvicto and Leqvio-and key upcoming launches. Over the longer term, we expect growth will come through delivering high-value medicines that sustain and replace our existing growth drivers. Our R\&D strategy focuses on an end-to-end approach, covering research, development and commercialization. We concentrate resources on priority programs to maximize early-stage potential and ensure effective latestage execution. We also focus on life-cycle management by enhancing the evidence base for key brands. We increase our chances of discovering new medicines by collaborating with outside researchers and biotech companies. Our network consists of academic and industry alliances working on joint research and drug discovery.
- Embed operational excellence to deliver returns. In an increasingly competitive environment, we are simplifying processes and reducing costs to become more efficient and effective in our decision-making and to free up resources for investment in new medicines. Our goal is to continue making attractive returns to shareholders while creating value for patients, healthcare systems and society. In our manufacturing sites, we are expanding capacity in strategic focus areas such as biopharmaceuticals and advanced technology platforms. For example, we are investing to expand our platform for RLT, a type of precision nuclear medicine that requires quick delivery to patients, since the activity of the radioisotope it contains diminishes over time. To ensure product quality, we maintain a quality management system for our medicines in compliance with requirements from health authorities and other regulators. We are also switching more of our production to renewable energy and reducing the environmental footprint of our sites.
- Strengthen our foundations. We continue to invest in the foundations of our long-term success. We have made progress in strengthening our culture to attract and retain talent, while developing artificial intelligence capabilities across our value chain and continuing to build trust with stakeholders and society.

## Company overview

Net sales from continuing operations were USD 50.3 billion, up 11\% in USD reported terms and 12\% measured in constant currencies (cc) ${ }^{1}$ to remove the impact of exchange rate movements. Net sales growth was driven by volume growth of 14 percentage points. Generic competition had a negative impact of 2 percentage points and pricing was flat. Sales in the US were USD 21.1 billion ( $+18 \%$ ) and in the rest of the world USD 29.2 billion ( $+6 \%,+8 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ).

Sales growth was mainly driven by continued strong performance from Entresto (USD 7.8 billion, $+30 \%,+31 \%$ cc), Cosentyx (USD 6.1 billion, $+23 \%,+25 \%$ cc), Kesimpta (USD 3.2 billion, $+49 \%,+49 \%$ cc), Kisqali (USD 3.0 billion, $+46 \%,+49 \%$ cc), Pluvicto (USD 1.4 billion, $+42 \%$, $+42 \%$ cc) and Leqvio (USD 754 million, $+112 \%,+114 \%$ cc), partly offset by erosion due to generic competition,
mainly for Lucentis and Gilenya, and the Xiidra ${ }^{\circledR}$ divestment.

In the US (USD 21.1 billion, +18\%), sales growth was mainly driven by Entresto, Cosentyx, Kesimpta, Kisqali, Pluvicto and Leqvio, partly offset by the Xiidra ${ }^{\circledR}$ divestment and the impact of generic competition on Gilenya. In Europe (USD 15.6 billion, $+4 \%,+5 \%$ cc), sales growth was mainly driven by Entresto, Kesimpta, Pluvicto and Kisqali, partly offset by erosion due to generic competition, mainly for Lucentis and Gilenya. Sales in emerging growth markets ${ }^{2}$ were USD 12.9 billion ( $+11 \%,+15 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ), including USD 3.9 billion of sales from China ( $+19 \%,+21 \%$ cc).

Operating income from continuing operations was USD 14.5 billion ( $+49 \%,+55 \%$ cc), mainly driven by higher net sales, lower impairments, amortization and


### Page 46 ###

restructuring charges, partly offset by prior-year onetime income from legal matters and higher R\&D investments. Operating income margin was $28.9 \%$ of net sales, increasing 7.4 percentage points (+8.1 percentage points cc).

Net income from continuing operations was USD 11.9 billion ( $+39 \%,+45 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ), mainly driven by higher operating income from continuing operations, partly offset by higher income taxes, mainly resulting from higher income before taxes from continuing operations in the current year and non-recurring tax benefits in the prior year. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was USD 5.92 ( $+43 \%,+49 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ), growing faster than net income, benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.

Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to USD 17.6 billion, compared with USD 14.2 billion in 2023. This increase was mainly driven by higher net income from continuing operations, adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments, including divestment gains, lower payments out of provisions and lower income taxes paid, mainly due to the timing of income tax payments, partly offset by unfavorable changes in working capital and higher net interest paid and other financial payments.

Free cash flow ${ }^{1}$ from continuing operations amounted to USD 16.3 billion ( $+24 \%$ USD), compared with USD 13.2 billion in 2023, driven by higher net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations.

We also present our core results ${ }^{1}$, which exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets, impairments, business acquisitions, divestments, and other significant items, including restructuring and related items, to help investors understand our underlying performance.

Core operating income from continuing operations was USD 19.5 billion ( $+19 \%,+22 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ), mainly driven by
higher net sales, partly offset by higher R\&D investments. Core operating income margin from continuing operations was $38.7 \%$ of net sales, increasing 2.7 percentage points ( +3.3 percentage points cc).

Core net income from continuing operations was USD 15.8 billion ( $+17 \%,+21 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ), mainly due to higher core operating income. Core basic earnings per share from continuing operations was USD 7.81 ( $+21 \%,+24 \%$ cc), growing faster than core net income from continuing operations, benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.

As the Sandoz spin-off was completed on October 3, 2023, there were no operating results in 2024 related to discontinued operations. In 2023, discontinued operations net sales were USD 7.4 billion, operating income amounted to USD 265 million and net income from discontinued operations was USD 6.3 billion driven by the IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, non-taxable, net gain on distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders, which amounted to USD 5.9 billion.

Total Company net income was USD 11.9 billion in 2024, compared with USD 14.9 billion in 2023 and basic EPS was USD 5.92 compared with USD 7.15 in prior year as the prior year included the IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, non-taxable, net gain on distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders, which amounted to USD 5.9 billion. Net cash flows from operating activities for total Company amounted to USD 17.6 billion and free cash flow amounted to USD 16.3 billion.

## CARDIOVASCULAR, RENAL AND METABOLIC

Net sales in the cardiovascular, renal and metabolic therapeutic area were USD 8.6 billion ( $+34 \%,+36 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ), with sales growth mainly driven by Entresto.

Entresto (USD 7.8 billion, $+30 \%,+31 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ) sustained robust, demand-led growth. In the US and Europe, Entresto penetration grew through the continued adoption of guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure. In China and Japan, Entresto volume growth was fueled by heart failure as well as hypertension. In the US, Novartis is in ANDA litigation with generic manufacturers. Novartis successfully appealed to uphold the validity of its combination patent covering Entresto and combinations of sacubitril and valsartan, which expires in 2025 (with pediatric exclusivity). Several generics have received final approval in the US. Novartis filed a lawsuit against FDA challenging the approval of one generic ANDA, which is now on appeal. Any US commercial launch of a generic Entresto product prior to the final outcome of the combination patent litigation, or ongoing litigations involving other patents or the FDA, may be at risk of later litigation developments.

Leqvio (USD 0.8 billion, $+112 \%,+114 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ) launch in the US and other markets is ongoing, delivering a medicine with effective and consistent LDL-C reduction in two maintenance doses per year. Focus remains on increased account and patient adoption and continuing medical education. Leqvio is registered in more than 105 countries world-wide and commercially available in 78 countries. Novartis obtained global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Leqvio under a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.

## IMMUNOLOGY

Net sales in the immunology therapeutic area reached USD 9.3 billion ( $+19 \%,+21 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ), with sales growth mainly driven by Cosentyx.

Cosentyx (USD 6.1 billion, $+23 \%,+25 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ) sales grew mainly in the US, emerging growth markets and Europe, driven by strong demand from launches (including the HS indication and the IV formulation in the US) and volume growth in core indications (PsO, PsA, AS and nr-axSpA). Since initial approval in 2015, Cosentyx has shown sustained efficacy and a robust safety profile, treating more than 1.7 million patients across eight indications.

Xolair (USD 1.6 billion, ex-US $+12 \%,+15 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ) growth was driven mainly by emerging growth markets. Novartis co-promotes Xolair with Genentech in the US and shares a portion of revenue as operating income but does not record any US sales.

Ilaris (USD 1.5 billion, $+11 \%,+14 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ) sales grew across most regions, led by the US. Contributors to growth include strong performance in the Periodic Fever Syndromes and Still's disease indications.

## NEUROSCIENCE

Net sales in the neuroscience therapeutic area were USD 4.8 billion ( $+30 \%,+31 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ), with sales growth mainly driven by Kesimpta.

Kesimpta (USD 3.2 billion, $+49 \%,+49 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ) sales grew across all regions driven by increased demand and strong access. Kesimpta is a high efficacy B-cell therapy, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile and an at-home self-administration for a broad population of RMS patients. Kesimpta is now approved in 90 countries with more than 130,000 patients treated.

Zolgensma (USD 1.2 billion, $0 \%,+2 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ) sales were stable (USD) and grew slightly (cc) compared with prior year, as it continues to treat mainly incident patients in established markets. Zolgensma is now approved in 58 countries with more than 4,500 patients treated globally through clinical trials, early access programs and in the commercial setting.

Aimovig (USD 0.3 billion, $+17 \%,+18 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ) sales grew mainly in Europe driven by increased demand for migraine prevention. Novartis commercializes Aimovig ex-US and ex-Japan, while Amgen retains all rights in the US and in Japan.

## ONCOLOGY

Net sales in the oncology therapeutic area were USD 14.7 billion ( $+15 \%,+16 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ), with sales growth mainly driven by Kisqali, Pluvicto, Scemblix and Jakavi.

Kisqali (USD 3.0 billion, $+46 \%,+49 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ) sales grew strongly across all regions, with increasing recognition of the consistently demonstrated overall survival benefit across all Ph3 clinical trials in HR+/ HER2- metastatic breast cancer (mBC), as well as Category 1 preferred NCCN guidelines recommendation and highest ESMOMCBS scores in both mBC and early breast cancer (eBC) indications. Kisqali was approved for eBC in September 2024 in the US and November 2024 in the EU. In the fourth quarter, the Kisqali US eBC launch showed promising early uptake in line with the broad population of eBC patients, including those with node-negative disease, covered in the label. Novartis is in US ANDA litigation with generic manufacturers.

Promacta/Revolade (USD 2.2 billion, $-2 \%,-1 \%$ cc) sales declined slightly following discontinued proactive promotion in most markets.

Tafinlar + Mekinist (USD 2.1 billion, $+7 \%,+9 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ) sales grew mainly in emerging growth markets, the US and Japan driven by demand in BRAF+ adjuvant melanoma, NSCLC, pediatric low-grade glioma, and tumor agnostic indications, while maintaining demand in the highly competitive BRAF+ metastatic melanoma market.

Jakavi (USD 1.9 billion, $+13 \%,+15 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ) sales grew across all regions driven by strong demand in all indications. Incyte retains all rights to ruxolitinib (Jakafi') in the US.

Tasigna (USD 1.7 billion, $-10 \%,-8 \%$ cc) sales declined across all regions due to lower demand and increasing competition.

Pluvicto (USD 1.4 billion, $+42 \%,+42 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ) sales grew in the US and Europe. Pluvicto is the only radioligand therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who have already been treated with other anti-cancer treatments (ARPI and taxane-based chemotherapy). Pluvicto is now on the market in several ex-US countries. Novartis is in patent

litigation with a manufacturer developing a radiopharmaceutical to treat PSMA-positive prostate cancer.

Lutathera (USD 0.7 billion, $+20 \%,+20 \%$ cc) sales grew across all regions due to increased demand, and earlier line adoption (within indication) in the US and Japan. Novartis is in patent litigation with manufacturers having FDA applications referencing Lutathera.

Scemblix (USD 0.7 billion, $+67 \%,+68 \%$ cc) sales grew across all regions, demonstrating continued high unmet need for effective and tolerable treatment options for adult CML patients previously treated with two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as well as initial uptake among early-line patients in the US following FDA accelerated approval in October 2024.

Piqray/Vijoice (USD 0.4 billion, $-11 \%,-11 \%$ cc) sales declined mostly in the US due to increased competition.

Kymriah (USD 0.4 billion, $-13 \%,-12 \%$ cc) sales declined across most regions, partly offset by strong performance in pediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) in the US, and follicular lymphoma indication uptake ex-US.

Fabhalta (USD 0.1 billion) launch continues in PNH globally, as well as in IgA nephropathy in the US
following FDA accelerated approval in this indication in August 2024.

## ESTABLISHED BRANDS

The established brands had net sales of USD 13.0 billion $(-12 \%,-11 \% \mathrm{cc})$.

Sandostatin Group (USD 1.3 billion, $-3 \%,-1 \%$ cc) sales declined slightly, primarily in the US, partly due to generics entry in the fourth quarter.

Lucentis (USD 1.0 billion, ex-US - $29 \%,-28 \%$ cc) sales declined in Europe, emerging growth markets, and Japan, mainly due to competition.

Exforge Group (USD 0.7 billion, $-1 \%,+2 \%$ cc) sales declined slightly (USD) and grew slightly (cc), with growth mainly in emerging growth markets.

Galvus Group (USD 0.6 billion, $-13 \%,-6 \%$ cc) sales declined mainly in Europe, primarily due to generic competition, partly offset by growth in emerging growth markets.

Diovan Group (USD 0.6 billion, $-4 \%, 0 \%$ cc) sales declined (USD) and remained stable (cc), as a decline in the US offset growth primarily in emerging growth markets.

Gilenya (USD 0.6 billion, $-40 \%,-39 \%$ cc) sales declined due to competition, mainly in the US and Europe.

$\mathrm{nm}=$ not meaningful

## Interest expense and other financial income and expense

Interest expense amounted to USD 1.0 billion compared with USD 855 million in the prior year mainly due to an increase in financial debts.

Other financial income and expense amounted to an income of USD 140 million, broadly in line with the prior-year.

## Income taxes

The tax rate was $12.5 \%$ compared with $6.0 \%$ in the prior year period. The current year tax rate was favorably impacted by the effect of changes in uncertain tax positions and other items that mostly offset. The prior year tax rate was favorably impacted by the effect of tax benefits from the write-down of investments in subsidiaries, non-taxable net gains on unrealized foreign currency results, recognition of deferred tax assets on prior years tax loss carry-forwards, non-taxable income related to legal matters, and other items including impact of tax rate changes. Excluding these impacts, the current year
tax rate would have been $15.0 \%$ compared with $15.3 \%$ in the prior year period. The decrease from the prior year was mainly the result of a change in profit mix, partially offset by the impact of a tax charge related to the expansion of products included in the Swiss patent box regime, and the impact of a Pillar Two tax charge in Switzerland.

## Net income from continuing operations

Net income from continuing operations was USD 11.9 billion ( $+39 \%,+45 \% \mathrm{cc}$ ), mainly driven by higher operating income from continuing operations, partly offset by higher income taxes, mainly resulting from higher income before taxes from continuing operations in the current year and non-recurring tax benefits in the prior year.

## Earnings per share from continuing operations

Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was USD $5.92(+43 \%,+49 \% \mathrm{cc})$, growing faster than net income from continuing operations, benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.

## Core interest expense and other financial income and expense

Core interest expense amounted to USD 1.0 billion compared with USD 855 million in the prior year mainly due to an increase in financial debts.

Core other financial income and expense amounted to an income of USD 295 million compared with an income of USD 430 million in the prior year, mainly due to lower interest income and higher currency losses.

## Core income taxes

The core tax rate (core taxes as a percentage of core income before tax) was $16.1 \%$ and $15.6 \%$ in the prior year. The increase from the prior year was mainly the result of a change in profit mix and the impact of a tax charge related to the expansion of products included in the

## Discontinued operations

Discontinued operations include the Sandoz, generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars division and certain corporate activities attributable to Sandoz prior to the spin-off up to the distribution date of October 3, 2023 and certain other expenses related to the spin-off. Included in 2023 is also the IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, non-taxable net gain on the distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders of USD 5.9 billion, representing mainly the excess amount of the IFRS Accounting Standards distribution liability, which is the estimated fair value of the Sandoz business distributed to Novartis AG shareholders, over the then carrying value of Sandoz business net assets. There were no operating results for 2024 related to discontinued operations.

## Total Company

Total Company net income was USD 11.9 billion in 2024, compared with USD 14.9 billion in 2023 and basic EPS was USD 5.92 compared to USD 7.15 in prior year as the prior year included the IFRS Accounting Standards noncash, non-taxable, net gain on distribution of Sandoz

Swiss patent box regime, and the impact of a Pillar Two tax charge in Switzerland.

## Core net income from continuing operations

Core net income from continuing operations was USD 15.8 billion ( $+17 \%,+21 \%$ cc), mainly due to higher core operating income from continuing operations.

## Core earnings per share from continuing operations

Core basic earnings per share from continuing operations was USD $7.81(+21 \%,+24 \% \mathrm{cc})$, growing faster than core net income from continuing operations, benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.

In 2023, discontinued operations net sales were USD 7.4 billion, operating income amounted to USD 265 million and net income from discontinued operations was USD 6.3 billion driven by the IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, non-taxable, net gain on distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders, which amounted to USD 5.9 billion.

# Factors affecting comparability of year-on-year results of operations 

## Significant transactions

The comparability of the year-on-year results of our operations for the total Company can be significantly affected by acquisitions and divestments. As part of our long-term strategy to focus Novartis as a leading medicines company, we announced and/or completed several acquisitions and divestments during 2024 and 2023.

A detailed description of significant transactions in 2024 and 2023 can be found in "Item 18. Financial State-ments-Note 2. Significant acquisitions of businesses and spin-off of Sandoz business."

## Internal control over financial reporting

The Company's management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm also issued an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Both the Company's management and its independent registered public
accounting firm concluded that the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. For more information, see "Item 15. Controls and Procedures."

## Approach to risk management

# Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis 

Novartis uses certain non-IFRS Accounting Standards metrics when measuring performance, especially when measuring current-year results against prior periods, including core results, constant currencies and free cash flow. These are referred to by Novartis as non-IFRS measures.

Despite the use of these measures by management in setting goals and measuring the Company's performance, these are non-IFRS measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS Accounting Standards. As a result, such measures have limits in their usefulness to investors.

Because of their non-standardized definitions, the non-IFRS measures (unlike IFRS Accounting Standards measures) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. These non-IFRS measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how the Company's management assesses underlying performance. These non-IFRS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for IFRS Accounting Standards measures, and should be viewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.

As an internal measure of Company performance, these non-IFRS measures have limitations, and the Company's performance management process is not solely restricted to these metrics.

## Core results

The Company's core results - including core operating income, core net income and core earnings per share exclude fully the amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets, excluding software, net gains and losses on fund investments and equity securities valued at fair value through profit and loss, impact of IAS Standards 29 "Financial reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies" to other financial income and expense, and certain acquisition- and divestment-related items. The following items that exceed a threshold of USD 25 million are also excluded: integration- and divestment-related income and expenses; divestment gains and losses; restructuring charges/releases and related items; legal-related items; impairments of property, plant and equipment, software, and financial assets, and income and expense items that management deems exceptional and that are or are expected to accumulate within the year to be over a USD 25 million threshold.

Novartis believes that investor understanding of the Company's performance is enhanced by disclosing core measures of performance, since core measures exclude items that can vary significantly from year to year, they enable better comparison of business performance across years. For this same reason, Novartis uses these core measures in addition to IFRS Accounting Standards measures and other measures as important factors in assessing the Company's performance.

The following are examples of how these core measures are used:

- In addition to monthly reports containing financial information prepared under IFRS Accounting Standards, senior management receives a monthly analysis incorporating these non-IFRS core measures.
- Annual budgets are prepared for both IFRS Accounting Standard measures and non-IFRS core measures.

As an internal measure of Company performance, the core results measures have limitations, and the Company's performance management process is not solely restricted to these metrics. A limitation of the core results measures is that they provide a view of the Company's operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition, divestment, or amortization/impairments of intangible assets, impairments to property, plant and equipment and restructurings and related items.

## Constant currencies

Changes in the relative values of non-US currencies to the US dollar can affect the Company's financial results and financial position. To provide additional information that may be useful to investors, including changes in sales volume, we present information about our net sales and various values relating to operating and net income that are adjusted for such foreign currency effects.

Constant currency calculations have the goal of eliminating two exchange rate effects so that an estimate can be made of underlying changes in the consolidated income statement excluding the impact of fluctuations in exchanges rates:

- The impact of translating the income statements of consolidated entities from their non-USD functional currencies to USD
- The impact of exchange rate movements on the major transactions of consolidated entities performed in currencies other than their functional currency.

We calculate constant currency measures by translating the current year's foreign currency values for sales and other income statement items into USD (excluding the IAS Standards 29 "Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies" adjustments to the local currency income statements of subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies), using the average exchange rates from the prior year and comparing them to the prior year values in USD.

We use these constant currency measures in evaluating the Company's performance, since they may assist us in evaluating our ongoing performance from year to year. However, in performing our evaluation, we also consider equivalent measures of performance that are not affected by changes in the relative value of currencies.


### Page 55 ###

## Growth rate calculation

For ease of understanding, Novartis uses a sign convention for its growth rates such that a reduction in operating expenses or losses compared with the prior year is shown as a positive growth.

## Free cash flow

Novartis defines free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Management believes that this definition provides a performance measure that focuses on core operating activities, and also excludes items that can vary significantly from year to year, thereby enabling better comparison of business performance across years.

Free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure, which means it should not be interpreted as a measure determined under IFRS Accounting Standards. Free cash flow is not intended to be a substitute measure for net cash flows from operating activities as determined under IFRS Accounting Standards. Free cash flow is presented as additional information because management believes it is a useful supplemental indicator of the Company's
ability to operate without reliance on additional borrowing or use of existing cash. Free cash flow is a measure of the net cash generated that is available for investment in strategic opportunities, returning to shareholders and for debt repayment.

## Additional information

## Net debt

Novartis calculates net debt as current financial debts and derivative financial instruments plus non-current financial debt less cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, commodities, time deposits and derivative financial instruments.

Net debt is presented as additional information because it sets forth how management monitors net debt or liquidity and management believes it is a useful supplemental indicator of the Company's ability to pay dividends, to meet financial commitments, and to invest in new strategic opportunities, including strengthening its balance sheet.

For the table that shows the Company's net debt, see "- Item 5.B Liquidity and capital resources - Company liquidity, financial debts and net debt."

## Cash flow

Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to USD 17.6 billion, compared with USD 14.2 billion in 2023. This increase was mainly driven by higher net income from continuing operations, adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments, including divestment gains, lower payments out of provisions and lower income taxes paid, mainly due to the timing of income tax payments, partly offset by unfavorable changes in working capital and higher net interest paid and other financial payments.

In 2023, net cash flows from operating activities from discontinued operations amounted to USD 0.2 billion (2024: nil).

Net cash outflows used in investing activities from continuing operations amounted to USD 7.5 billion, compared with USD 6.7 billion net cash inflows in 2023.

In the current year, net cash outflows used in investing activities from continuing operations were mainly driven by USD 3.9 billion net cash outflows for acquisitions and divestments of businesses, including the acquisition of Kate Therapeutics for USD 0.4 billion; the acquisition of Mariana Oncology for USD 1.0 billion (USD 1.04 billion, net of cash acquired of USD 80 million); and the acquisition of MorphoSys for USD 2.3 billion (USD 2.5 billion, net of cash acquired of USD 0.2 billion). In addition, the cash outflows for purchases of intangible assets amounted to USD 2.4 billion; purchases of property, plant and equipment amounted to USD 1.4 billion; purchases of financial assets amounted to USD 0.2 billion and net purchases of marketable securities, commodities and time deposits amounted to USD 0.7 billion. These cash outflows were partly offset by cash inflows of USD 1.0 billion from the sale of financial assets (including USD 0.7 billion proceeds from the sale of Sandoz Group AG shares by consolidated foundations); and by USD 0.2 billion from the sale of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.

In 2023, net cash inflows from investing activities from continuing operations of USD 6.7 billion were driven by the net proceeds of USD 10.6 billion from the sale of marketable securities, commodities and time deposits; USD 2.0 billion from the sale of intangible assets (including USD 1.75 billion cash proceeds from the divestment of the 'front of eye' ophthalmology assets to Bausch + Lomb); USD 0.3 billion from the sale of financial assets; and USD 0.2 billion from the sale of property, plant and equipment (including proceeds from the sale and leaseback of real estate). These cash inflows were partly offset by cash outflows of USD 3.6 billion for acquisitions and divestments of businesses, net (including the acquisition of Chinook Therapeutics for USD 3.1 billion, net of cash acquired of USD 0.1 billion, and the acquisition of DTx for USD 0.5 billion, net of cash acquired of USD 0.1 billion); USD 1.7 billion for purchases of intangible assets; USD 1.1 billion for purchases of property, plant and equipment; and USD 0.1 billion for purchases of financial assets.

In 2023, net cash outflows used in investing activities from discontinued operations amounted to USD 1.1 billion (2024: nil).

Net cash outflows used in financing activities from continuing operations amounted to USD 11.7 billion, compared with USD 17.6 billion in 2023.

In the current year, net cash outflows used in financing activities from continuing operations were mainly driven by USD 8.3 billion for net treasury share transactions; USD 7.6 billion for the dividend payment; the USD 2.15 billion repayment of a US dollar bond at maturity, and the USD 0.3 billion repayments of other current financial debts. Cash outflows for MorphoSys shares purchased outside the Offer amounted to USD 0.3 billion, which included a USD 0.2 billion payment to the former remaining minority shareholders in connection with the "squeeze-out." These cash outflows were partly offset by cash inflows from the issuance of bonds totaling


### Page 61 ###

USD 6.1 billion (Swiss franc denominated bonds with a notional amount of CHF 2.2 billion, equivalent to USD 2.5 billion, and US dollar denominated bonds with a notional amount of USD 3.7 billion). The change in current financial debts resulted in net cash inflows of USD 1.0 billion.

In 2023, net cash outflows used in financing activities from continuing operations of USD 17.6 billion were mainly driven by USD 8.6 billion for net treasury share transactions; USD 7.3 billion for the dividend payment;

USD 2.2 billion for the repayment of two EUR denominated bonds (notional amounts of EUR 1.25 billion and of EUR 0.75 billion) at maturity. Payments of lease liabilities amounted to USD 0.3 billion. These cash outflows were partly offset by cash inflows of USD 0.5 billion from the net increase in current financial debts.

In 2023, net cash inflows from financing activities from discontinued operations amounted to USD 3.3 billion (2024: nil).

## Assets

Total non-current assets of USD 72.5 billion increased by USD 3.1 billion compared with December 31, 2023.

Intangible assets other than goodwill were broadly in line with December 31, 2023, mainly as the impact of the business acquisitions of Kate Therapeutics, Mariana Oncology, and MorphoSys and additions, were offset by amortization, impairments and unfavorable currency translation effects.

Goodwill increased by USD 1.4 billion mainly due to the impact of the business acquisitions of Kate Therapeutics, Mariana Oncology and MorphoSys, partially offset by an impairment and unfavorable currency translation effects.

Financial assets decreased by USD 0.6 billion mainly due to the sale of Sandoz Group AG shares by consolidated foundations.

Other non-current assets increased by USD 2.3 billion mainly due the increase of prepaid post-employment benefit plans. This increase is due to the pension plans in Switzerland not being required to continue to apply the IFRS Standards limitation on recognition of fund surplus (the asset ceiling) as at December 31, 2024.

Property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, deferred tax assets and investments in associated companies were broadly in line with December 31, 2023.

Total current assets of USD 29.7 billion decreased by USD 0.8 billion compared with December 31, 2023.


### Page 64 ###

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by USD 1.9 billion mainly as cash generated through operating activities of USD 17.6 billion and net proceeds from changes in financial debts of USD 4.7 billion, were offset by the USD 7.6 billion dividend payment, USD 8.3 billion for net purchases of treasury shares, USD 3.9 billion mainly for the business acquisitions of Kate Therapeutics, Mariana Oncology and MorphoSys, USD 3.6 billion for net purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and other net cash outflows from investing and financing activities and currency effects of USD 0.8 billion.

Marketable securities, commodities, time deposits and derivative financial instruments increased by USD 1.0 billion. Trade receivables increased by USD 0.3 billion, mainly driven by the increase in net sales and other current assets increased by USD 0.4 billion. Income tax receivables decreased by USD 0.3 billion. Inventories were broadly in line with December 31, 2023.

We consider our provisions for doubtful trade receivables to be adequate. We particularly monitor the level of trade receivables in countries deemed to have an elevated credit risk. We consider macroeconomic environment, historical experience, country and political risks, in addition to other relevant information when assessing risk. These risk factors are monitored regularly to determine any adjustments to risk classification. The majority of the past due trade receivables from elevated credit risk countries are due from local governments or from government-funded entities. Deteriorating credit, economic conditions and other factors in these elevated credit risk countries have resulted in, and may continue to result in an increase in the average time that it takes to collect these trade receivables and may require the Company to re-evaluate the expected credit loss amount of these trade receivables in future periods. As at December 31, 2024, amounts past due for more than one year were not significant in elevated credit risk countries.

For a table showing an overview of the aging analysis of total trade receivables and the total amount of the provision for doubtful trade receivables as at December 31, 2024, and 2023, see "Item 18. Financial StatementsNote 15. Trade receivables."

There is also a risk that certain countries could devalue their currency. Currency exposures are described in more detail in "-Effects of currency fluctuations."

## Liabilities

Total non-current liabilities of USD 29.4 billion increased by USD 2.6 billion compared with December 31, 2023.

Non-current financial debts increased by USD 2.9 billion mainly due to the issuance of Swiss franc denominated bonds of USD 2.5 billion (notional amount of CHF 2.2 billion), the issuance of US dollar denominated bonds with a notional amount of USD 3.7 billion and financial
debts acquired through the MorphoSys business acquisition of USD 0.6 billion, partly offset by the reclassification of USD 3.3 billion from non-current to current financial debts consisting of two US dollar denominated bonds with notional amount of USD 2.8 billion and a Swiss franc denominated bond of notional amount of CHF 0.5 billion all maturing in 2025.

Provisions and other non-current liabilities decreased by USD 0.4 billion. Non-current lease liabilities and deferred tax liabilities were broadly in line with December 31, 2023.

Total current liabilities of USD 28.7 billion increased by USD 2.3 billion compared with December 31, 2023.

Current financial debts and derivative financial instruments increased by USD 2.1 billion compared with December 31, 2023, mainly due to the issuance of commercial paper notes under the US commercial paper program and the reclassification of USD 3.3 billion from non-current to current financial debts consisting of two US dollar denominated bonds with notional amount of USD 2.8 billion and a Swiss franc denominated bond of notional amount of CHF 0.5 billion all maturing in 2025, partly offset by the repayment of a US dollar bond at maturity of USD 2.15 billion.

Trade payables decreased by USD 0.4 billion. Provisions and other current liabilities increased by USD 0.9 billion mainly driven by the increase in provisions for deductions from revenue. Current income tax liabilities decreased by USD 0.3 billion. Current lease liabilities were broadly in line with December 31, 2023.

In our key countries, Switzerland and the United States, assessments have been agreed by the tax authorities up to 2020 in Switzerland and up to 2016 in the United States.

Novartis believes that its total provisions are adequate based upon currently available information. However, given the inherent difficulties in estimating these liabilities, Novartis may incur additional costs beyond the amounts provided. Management believes that such additional amounts, if any, would not be material to the Company's financial condition but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in a given period.

## Equity

The Company's equity decreased by USD 2.6 billion to USD 44.1 billion compared with December 31, 2023.

This decrease was mainly driven by the net income of USD 11.9 billion, actuarial gains from defined benefit plans of USD 2.0 billion (mainly due to Swiss pension plans not being required to apply the asset ceiling in 2024) and favorable impact from equity-based compensation of USD 1.1 billion being more than offset by the purchase of treasury shares of USD 8.5 billion, the cash-dividend to Novartis AG shareholders of USD 7.6 billion and unfavorable currency translation effects of USD 1.6 billion.

In 2024, Novartis repurchased a total of 77.5 million shares for USD 8.3 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line. These purchases included 68.8 million shares (USD 7.3 billion) under the up-to USD 15 billion share buyback announced in July 2023 (with up to USD 5.4 billion still to be executed). In addition, 8.7 million shares (USD 1.0 billion) were repurchased to mitigate the impact of share deliveries under the equi-ty-based compensation plans for employees. Furthermore, 1.2 million shares (equity value of USD 0.1 billion) were repurchased from employees. In the same period, 9.8 million shares (equity value of USD 1.1 billion) were delivered as a result of share deliveries related to employee equity-based compensation plans. Consequently, the total number of shares outstanding decreased by 68.9 million versus December 31, 2023. These treasury share transactions resulted in an equity decrease of USD 7.4 billion and a net cash outflow of USD 8.3 billion.

In 2023, Novartis repurchased a total of 87.5 million shares for USD 8.4 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line.

# Effects of currency fluctuations 

We transact our business in many currencies other than the US dollar, our reporting currency.
The following table provides an overview of net sales and operating expenses from continuing operations based on IFRS Accounting Standards values, for the most important currencies to the Company:

| Currency | 2024 |  | 2023 |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | Net sales from continuing operations $\%$ | Operating expenses from continuing operations $\%^{1}$ | Net sales from continuing operations $\%$ | Operating expenses from continuing operations $\%^{1}$ |
| US dollar (USD) | 44 | 39 | 42 | 37 |
| Euro (EUR) | 23 | 23 | 24 | 20 |
| Swiss franc (CHF) | 1 | 18 | 1 | 22 |
| Chinese yuan (CNY) | 8 | 5 | 7 | 4 |
| Japanese yen (JPY) | 4 | 2 | 4 | 2 |
| Canadian dollar (CAD) | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 |
| British pound (GBP) | 2 | 2 | 2 | 5 |
| Russian ruble (RUB) | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Brazilian real (BRL) | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 |
| Australian dollar (AUD) | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| Other currencies | 12 | 9 | 14 | 8 |

${ }^{1}$ Operating expenses include cost of goods sold, selling, general and administration, research and development; other income and other expense.

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in US dollars. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and other currencies can have a significant effect on both the Company's results of operations as well as the reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows. This in turn may significantly affect reported earnings (both positively and negatively) and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations.

For purposes of our consolidated balance sheets, we translate assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies into US dollars at the prevailing market exchange rates as of the relevant balance sheet date. For purposes of the Company's consolidated income and cash flow statements, revenue, expense and cash flow items in local currencies are translated into US dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the relevant period. As a result, even if the amounts or values of these items remain unchanged in the respective local currency, changes in exchange rates have an impact on the amounts or values of these items in our consolidated financial statements.

Because our expenditure in Swiss francs is significantly higher than our revenue in Swiss francs, volatility
in the value of the Swiss franc can have a significant impact on the reported value of our earnings, assets and liabilities, and the timing and extent of such volatility can be difficult to predict.

The Company manages its global currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where management deems appropriate, after taking into account the natural hedging afforded by our global business activity. In 2024 and 2023, we entered into various contracts that change in value with movements in foreign exchange rates, to preserve the value of assets, commitments and expected transactions. We use forward contracts and foreign currency options to hedge. For more information on how these transactions affect our consolidated financial statements and on how foreign exchange rate exposure is managed, see "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Accounting policies," "Item 18. Financial StatementsNote 5. Interest expense and other financial income and expense," "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 15. Trade receivables," "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 27. Commitments and contingent liabilities" and "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 28. Financial instruments additional disclosures."

## Liquidity/short-term funding

The Company's liquidity amounted to USD 13.5 billion as at December 31, 2024, compared with USD 14.4 billion as at December 31, 2023. Total non-current and current
financial debts, including derivatives, amounted to USD 29.6 billion as at December 31, 2024, compared with USD 24.6 billion as at December 31, 2023.

We continuously track our liquidity position and asset/liability profile. This involves modeling cash flow maturity profiles based on both historical experiences and contractual expectations to project our liquidity requirements. We seek to preserve prudent liquidity and funding capabilities. We are confident that we have sufficient liquidity to support our normal business activities for the foreseeable future.

Certain countries have legal or economic restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances, but these restrictions do not have an impact on the ability of the Company to meet its cash obligations.

We are not aware of any significant demands to change the level of liquidity needed to support our normal business activities. We make use of various borrowing facilities provided by several financial institutions. We also successfully issued various bonds in previous years and raised funds through our commercial paper programs.

The maturity schedule of our net debt can be found in "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 28. Financial instruments - Additional disclosures-Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments-Liquidity risk."

# 6.B Compensation 

## Dear shareholder,

On behalf of the Compensation Committee of Novartis, I am pleased to present our 2024 Compensation Report.

## 2024 company performance

Novartis delivered an excellent performance in 2024, driven by sales growth in key brands and more costeffective operations. Compared with the prior year, net sales from continuing operations increased by $12 \%$ measured in constant currencies (cc), core operating income increased by $22 \%$ (cc) and free cash flow increased by USD 3.1 billion. Sales growth was mainly driven by Entresto, Cosentyx, Kesimpta, and Kisqali. The Company's performance led to two guidance upgrades for net sales and three for core operating income.

The compensation of the members of the Executive Committee of Novartis (ECN) is largely determined by performance evaluations conducted on both a shortterm basis through the Annual Incentive and a long-term basis via the Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP).

As an innovative medicines company, we consider innovation core to the value we bring to society. Innovation and certain ESG targets (e.g., access to medicines) are included in the Annual Incentive targets of all Executive Committee members. There are further innovation milestones which comprise $25 \%$ of the LTPP performance measurement. In 2024, our innovation highlights included the approval of Fabhalta in EU, China and Japan for adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), as well as in the US for adult patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). We also received accelerated approval in the US for Scemblix for newly diagnosed patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Kisqali was approved in the EU and US to reduce the risk of recurrence in people with early breast cancer.

## 2024 realized compensation

The company's performance in 2024 resulted in a total realized compensation for the CEO of CHF 19165 899, of which $88.5 \%$ was made up of variable components, which comprised an Annual Incentive at 160\% of target and a 2022-2024 LTPP at 158\% of target. The LTPP represents the largest component of the realized compensation.

The 2022-2024 LTPP cycle delivered strong results versus target, with both third-party sales CAGR (compound annual growth rate) and core operating income CAGR (both in cc) exceeding the level required for a maximum payout. Three-year sales performance from growth brands Entresto, Pluvicto, Kesimpta and Kisqali, all considerably exceeded expectations. Our bottom line was further strengthened through savings generated by our organizational transformation. Innovation performance was solid, as evidenced by the advances listed above. Our share price performance and year-on-year dividend increases resulted in a total return to shareholders of
$54 \%$ over the performance cycle which ranked 5th out of our 15 global healthcare peer companies (including Novartis). In addition, the 2022-2024 LTPP cycle payout accrued a $15.5 \%$ increase in share price between grant and vesting. In line with our plan rules, an additional twoyear holding period applies for the CEO (and CFO) vested shares (i.e. until January 2027). The Board of Directors did not make any discretionary adjustments to the incentive outcomes.

The chart below illustrates the strong correlation between the LTPP payout over the past five years and the three-year total shareholder return (TSR), demonstrating consistent alignment with shareholders' experience.

The performance outcomes described above also contributed to the total aggregated realized compensation of the other ECN members which was CHF 56580414.

For further details on the realized compensation, including a comparison with 2023 realized compensation, see "-CEO and Executive Committee 2024 realized compensation."

## Executive Committee compensation system changes

At the beginning of 2024, the Board of Directors incorporated significant changes into our executive compensation system, which were shaped with input from our shareholders as described in detail in last year's Compensation Report. These changes were strongly supported at the 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM), for which I would like to express my appreciation. We are confident that the changes place us in a better position to attract and retain the best talent on a global scale. No further material changes were made to the 2025 Executive Committee compensation system.

## Compensation Committee membership changes

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to William Winters, who will step down from the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors at the 2025 AGM, for his engagement and invaluable contributions throughout his 12-year tenure. At the 2025 AGM, we will propose to shareholders the nomination of John Young as a new member of the Compensation Committee. To facilitate his onboarding, John attended the last four Compensation Committee meetings as a guest.

## 2025 Annual General Meeting (AGM)

At the 2025 AGM, as in prior years, shareholders will be asked to vote on:

- The maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the Board of Directors from the 2025 AGM to the 2026 AGM. Board fees will remain unchanged compared with the prior term, with the exception of the annual Board Chair fee, which will be CHF 3.5 million from the 2025 AGM.
- The maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the Executive Committee for the financial year 2026, which remains the same as in the previous year.
- This 2024 Compensation Report (advisory vote), which follows the same structure as in the previous year.

We trust that this Report and our 2025 Say-on-Pay brochure provide you with the information required for you to vote in favor of the above. We continue to welcome your feedback, which is invaluable in driving improvements in our Executive Committee and Board of Directors' compensation systems and practices.

# CEO compensation and performance 

## 2024 fixed pay and benefits

| Annual base salary | The CEO 2024 base salary was: CHF 1872800 (2.4\% salary increase effective as of March 1, 2024, in line with <br> ordinary salary increases received by other Swiss employees). |
| :-- | :-- |

Pension and other benefits The CEO is a member of the Novartis Swiss pension funds, which provide company contributions on the base salary and an Annual Incentive up to the legal cap on the insured salary of CHF 882000 . No supplementary pension plans or savings plans are provided. The CEO's employer pension contributions represent $9.2 \%$ of the base salary.

## 2024 CEO Annual Incentive balanced scorecard

This section presents the balanced scorecard for the CEO. Financial performance is measured in constant currencies (cc) to reflect operational performance that can be influenced. Performance outcomes for compensation purposes may differ from reported numbers in accordance with our compensation adjustments policy.

| Measure | Weight (\%) | Target | Performance ${ }^{1}$ | Target <br> achievement |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Financial performance (cc) | 60 |  |  | Significantly above |
| Net sales (USD million) | 24 | 47838 | 49755 | Significantly above |
| Core operating income (USD million) | 18 | 17512 | 19025 | Significantly above |
| Free cash flow as a \% of net sales | 18 | $30.1 \%$ | $32.3 \%$ | Significantly above |

${ }^{1}$ Performance outcomes from compensation purposes are measured in cc and may differ from reported numbers in accordance with our compensation adjustments policy to consider items not known at the time of target setting e.g. favorable impacts from delayed US generic entry assumptions and M\&A/BD\&L deal costs.

As communicated in the 2023 Compensation Report, in 2024, core operating income replaced operating income in the ECN financial measures. The Board reviewed the core adjustments made on operating income (as indicated in Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects - 5.A Operating results - Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis - Reconciliation from IFRS Accounting Standards results to non-IFRS measure core result) to arrive at the performance outcomes in the table above and decided not to make any discretionary adjustments to the pay outcomes.

# 2024 CEO Annual Incentive balanced scorecard (continued) 

At the start of the performance cycle, the Board sets the CEO specific targets against each of the four strategic objectives listed below. We provide here a summary of those targets that most heavily impact overall performance and their respective achievement.

| Measure | Weight (\%) / Performance | Target achievement |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Strategic objectives | 40 | Above |
| Maintain growth momentum and ensure successful launches (10\%) | - Sales performance for growth drivers was 106\% of the 2024 target in cc, largely driven by Cosentyx and Entresto. <br> - Recent launches: Leqvio, Scemblix, Lutathera, Fabhalta and Pluvicto achieved combined sales in line with 2024 target in cc. <br> - US sales grew strongly 18\%, mainly driven by Entresto, Cosentyx, Kesimpta, Kisqali, Pluvicto and Leqvio, partly offset by the Xiidra ${ }^{\circledR}$ divestment and the impact of generic competition on Gilenya. <br> - Achieved 110\% of target sales calls across our top 8 markets. | Significantly above |
| Deliver pipeline and drive R\&D productivity (10\%) | - 7 (vs. target of 6) key approvals secured: iptacopan (Fabhalta) for PNH approved in EU, China and Japan, and for IgAN approved in the US, Kisqali for early breast cancer approved in the US and EU, as well as Scemblix 1L in the US. <br> - 15 (vs. target of 10) regulatory filings submitted, including Atrasentan IgAN in US and China, Scemblix 1L in the US, China and Japan, Iptacopan C3G in US, EU, China and Japan, IgAN in China, Pluvicto mCRPC, pre-taxane in US and Pluvicto mCRPC, post-taxane in China. Remibrutinib CSU submission was delayed to early 2025. <br> - 8 (vs. target of 6) new compounds transitioned into late-stage clinical development. <br> - 24 complementary BD\&L/M\&A deals signed, including the acquisitions of MorphoSys, Mariana Oncology, Kate Therapeutics, Calypso and IFM Due; deals with PTC Therapeutics, Arvinas, PeptiDream, DrenBio, Lindy Biosciences, Baiyu, Monte Rosa Tx, Ratio Therapeutics; and a partnership with Versant to create Borealis. The acquisition of Morphosys has faced significant challenges though work is ongoing on the acquired assets. | Met |
| Execute on operational excellence \& productivity (10\%) | - Core operating margin reached 38.7\%, bringing us closer to achieving our 2027 aspiration of $40 \%$. <br> - Lean Digital Core, our transformation program to future-proof the processes and technologies to enable core business capabilities, was launched in Turkey and Spain, and towards deployment in Germany, Netherlands, UK and the US. <br> - Workday, our Human Capital Management program was successfully launched on schedule in April. <br> - AI tools and technologies were used to generate: 3 (vs. 2 target) molecular leads, which progressed to in vivo studies, 1 (vs. 1 target) new target for Parkinson's disease, and 10 (vs. 10 target) trial design improvements. | Met |
| Strengthen foundations (ESG / Human Capital) (10\%) | - Maintained strong reputation across key external ESG indices: \#1 in the 2024 Access to Medicine Index, CDP's Climate Change and Water Security "A Lists" (only company in our peer group to achieve that score), AA ratings with MSCI. <br> - Across our portfolio, our medicines reached 296 million patients in approximately 120 countries. We continued to implement a global access strategy for 100\% of new medicines launched. <br> - Collaboration with The Max Foundation provided access to $>100,000$ patients across over 70 LMICs to key Novartis medicines such as Glivec, Tasigna, Scemblix, Kisqali and Femara. <br> - Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions reduced by 15\% from a 2022 base year, keeping us on track for our 2040 net zero target. Water consumption and waste reduced by 9\% and $17 \%$ from the prior year, respectively. | Above |

2024 was another strong performance exceeding external (consensus) and internal (targets) expectations. Sales, profit and free cash flow growth were strong. The focus on innovative medicines and simplification of our operations after the organizational restructuring are having a visible impact across the company. The Research and Development units performed in line with our plan with targeted project timelines acceleration across R\&D, and complementary BD\&L/M\&A deals were signed to bolster the company's pipeline, although the Morphosys acquisition resulted in some unexpected challenges. In view of these achievements, the Board of Directors decided on an Annual Incentive payout for the CEO amounting to CHF 4494 788, which is $\mathbf{1 6 0 \%}$ of target, within the range of $0-200 \%$.

# 2022-2024 LTPP cycle performance outcomes 

The charts below illustrate the very strong performance of the 2022-2024 LTPP cycle against target. The financial LTPP targets were recalibrated to take the Sandoz spin-off into account. Given that these metrics measure the compound annual growth rate, Sandoz targets were removed for the financial years 2023 and 2024. For the relative TSR measure, the dividend in kind distribution was treated as a one-time dividend that is not reinvested.

## THIRD-PARTY SALES CAGR

(25\% weighting)
Vesting range 0-200\% of target
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Our transformation into a pure-play innovative medicines company enabled a more focused allocation of resources and operational execution on priority brands. The following brands each exceeded their 2022-2024 sales target (set at the beginning of the cycle) by over USD 1 billion:

- Entresto: we strengthened our commercial focus and excellence across our targeted geographies.
- Pluvicto: product supply issues were promptly addressed as a higher eligible patient pool in the US drove increased sales.
- Kesimpta: streamlining our focus on neuroscience resulted in a larger share gain for the treatment of multiple sclerosis across several markets.
- Kisqali: following positive results from NATALEE and MONALEESA studies, we enhanced our investment and resource allocation in this brand.


## INNOVATION

(25\% weighting)

Innovation performance was solid, supported by 21 successful submissions across the three-year cycle, including the following highlights:

- approval of Fabhalta for PNH in the EU, Japan and China
- regulatory approval of Lutathera in pediatric GEP-NET in the US
- submission and accelerated approval of Scemblix 1L CML in the US
- approval of Fabhalta IgAN in the US
- submission of atrasentan IgAN to the FDA
- submission of Pluvicto mCRPC, pre-taxane to the FDA

Additionally, we presented Kisqali NATALEE updated data in eBC and Renal portfolio data at ERA (Fabhalta, atrasentan, zigakibart)

Based on input from the Science \& Technology Committee (STC), the Board of Directors approved a payout of $102 \%$ for this metric.

## CORE OPERATING INCOME (COI) CAGR

(25\% weighting)
Vesting range 0-200\% of target
![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)

COI CAGR outcome was equally successful reaching mid-teens growth as our strong sales performance was further strengthened by savings generated by our organizational transformation activities.

## RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR)

(25\% weighting)

| Novartis position <br> in the peer group | Payout range <br> (\% of target) |
| :-- | --: |
| Position 1 - 2 | $170 \%-200 \%$ |
| Position 3 - 5 | $130 \%-160 \%$ |
| Position 6 - 8 | $80 \%-120 \%$ |
| Position 9 - 15 | $0 \%$ |

TSR for the 2022-2024 cycle was 53.6\%. As a result, Novartis ranked No. 5 out of 15 healthcare companies (including Novartis), as our share price performance, growing dividend and spin-off of our generics business, Sandoz, generated considerable value to shareholders. Applying the payout curve directly, this resulted in a payout of $130 \%$ under this metric.

## 2022-2024 LTPP CYCLE PAYOUT

Overall, the Board of Directors approved a 2022-2024 LTPP cycle payout at $\mathbf{1 5 8 \%}$ of target, within the range of 0-200\%. This resulted in an LTPP payout of CHF 12468155 for the CEO, including dividend equivalents of CHF 1128701 and keep-whole awards (granted in connection with the Sandoz spin-off) of CHF 727 766. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee did not exercise any discretion and no adjustments were made in the evaluation of performance.

The performance tracking against target for our ongoing LTPP performance cycles is reported below.

## 2023-2025 LTPP cycle

After the first two years of the three-year LTPP cycle, third-party sales CAGR and core operating income CAGR are tracking significantly ahead of target, supported by the strong operational performance in financial years 2023 and 2024. Innovation is on track. At the end of 2024, the relative TSR for Novartis was in the top three of our global healthcare peer group.

# CEO and Executive Committee 

## CEO and Executive Committee 2024 realized compensation

To aid shareholders' understanding of the link between pay and performance, the Compensation Report discloses the realized compensation for the CEO on an individual basis, and for the other ECN members on an aggregated basis. Disclosing realized compensation means that the Annual Incentive and the LTPP are disclosed at the end of their respective performance cycles, reflecting actual payouts based on performance.

The total actual payout may vary year on year depending on multiple factors, including the composition of the Executive Committee and the tenure of its members (as new members may not have equity vestings), compensation increases, payout of variable compensation based on actual performance, share price fluctuations, and dividend equivalents.

The table below shows compensation for all ECN members for the financial year 2024, including base salary, pension, other benefits, 2024 Annual Incentive, 2022-2024 LTPP cycle payout, and any buyouts paid or vesting within the year. The table also includes the total 2023 realized compensation for all Executive Committee members for comparison.

To determine the appropriateness of 2024 CEO and executive compensation payouts under the Annual Incentive and LTPP, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee reviewed management's performance against targets set at the beginning of the cycles as described in "-2024 CEO Annual Incentive balanced scorecard" and "-2022-2024 LTPP cycle performance outcomes."

The incentive performance outcomes, combined with base salary and other benefits, pension, keep-whole awards (awards granted in connection with the Sandoz spin-off) and dividend equivalents, resulted in 2024 total realized compensation for the CEO of CHF 19165 899, an increase of $18 \%$ compared with 2023 (CHF 16248 178). This increase was largely driven by the higher performance payout of the 2022-2024 LTPP cycle ( $158 \%$ compared with $122 \%$ payout for the 2021-2023 LTPP cycle).

* All compensation amounts are stated gross, before the deduction of social security contributions and income tax paid by the Executive Committee members. Amounts for Executive Committee members paid in USD were converted at a rate of USD 1.00 = CHF 0.8805 , which is the same average exchange rate used in the Company's 2024 consolidated financial statements (a similar rule applies to payments made in other currencies during the year).
* Aggregate realized compensation of the other 10 Executive Committee members.
${ }^{8}$ Aggregate realized compensation of the other 11 Executive Committee members, including a member who stepped down during the financial year 2023. For more information, see item 6B of the 2023 Annual Report.
${ }^{9}$ The portion of the Annual Incentive delivered in equity is rounded up to the nearest share, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 24, 2025) of CHF 90.26 per Novartis share and USD 99.97 per ADR. At the start of the 2024 performance period, Vasant Narasimhan, Aharon Gal, Harry Kirsch, Steffen Lang and Klaus Moosmeyer had met their shareholding requirement and therefore received at least $30 \%$ of their Annual Incentive in equity. All other Executive Committee members who had not yet met their shareholding requirement at the start of the 2024 performance period, received at least $50 \%$ of their Annual Incentive in equity.
${ }^{10}$ The portion of the Annual Incentive delivered in equity is rounded up to the nearest share, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 24, 2024) of CHF 93.53 per Novartis share and USD 107.55 per ADR.
${ }^{11}$ The amount represents the underlying share value of the 397777 realized LTPP RSUs to the CEO and other Executive Committee members for the 2022-2024 LTPP cycle, including dividend equivalents for the three-year cycle of value CHF 1128701 for the CEO and CHF 2017311 for the other Executive Committee members. The taxable value is determined using the closing share price, on the day the payout factor is approved by the Board of Directors (January 24, 2025), of CHF 90.26 per Novartis share and USD 99.97 per ADR. Includes vested basis-whole shares received in connection with the Sandoz spin-off. During the course of the 2023 performance period, Victor Botha was promoted to the Executive Committee and Shivaram Aradhye reported Novartis. As such, the information disclosed reflects their pro-rata 2022-2024 LTPP payout attributable to the period in which they were members of the Executive Committee. Aharon Gal, Fiona Marshall and Patrick Horber joined Novartis after the 2022-2024 LTPP awards were made, and therefore did not receive an LTPP award for the 2022-2024 LTPP cycle.
${ }^{12}$ Based on the closing share price of January 24, 2024 of CHF 93.53 per Novartis share and USD 107.55 per ADR for all members.
${ }^{13}$ Includes any other perquisites, benefits in-kind, and international assignment benefits as per the global mobility policy (e.g., housing, international health insurance, children's school fees, tax equalization). The compensation and benefits elements related to the period after the step-down dates are also reported under 'other payments'.
${ }^{14}$ In line with the buyout policy of Novartis, the Annual Incentive Committee determines the amount of the 2024 capital (ASR) in the cycle range of CHF 107.550, which vested partially on March 31, 2024, and partially on May 1, 2024, to Fiona Marshall to replace compensation that she forfeited when leaving her previous employer. Includes also 3116 vested RSUs and 39976 PSUs (for a total value of CHF 3955 218), which vested partially on January 20, 2024, on February 1, 2024 and on January 26, 2025 as well as CHF 1058 274 paid in cash in March 2024, to Patrick Horber to replace compensation that he forfeited when leaving his previous employer. Includes also 3050 vested RSUs (for a total value of CHF 279 472), which vested on February 26, 2024, to Shivaram Aradhye to replace compensation that he forfeited when leaving his previous employer.
${ }^{15}$ Includes social security contributions to the extent that they result in a pension entitlement. Includes also contributions to company provided pension plans.
${ }^{16}$ This amount is out of total social security employer contributions of CHF 3279227 and pension employer contributions of CHF 2158144 paid in 2024 for all Executive Committee members.
${ }^{17}$ This amount is out of total social security employer contributions of CHF 1933476 and pension employer contributions of CHF 1852898 paid in 2023 for all Executive Committee members.

# Pay for performance assessment 

To assess whether the target-setting process provided for sufficiently stringent targets in the 2022-2024 LTPP cycle, the Compensation Committee reviewed the past five LTPP payouts. It found a strong correlation between the LTPP payout and the three-year total shareholder return, as shown in the table below, demonstrating alignment with shareholders' experience. The Committee also recognized the high variability of payouts across the years.

|  | $2020^{1}$ | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| LTPP three-year cycle payout (\% of target) | $126 \%$ | $107 \%$ | $57 \%$ | $122 \%$ | 158\% |
| Novartis three-year TSR in USD (\%) ${ }^{2}$ | $29 \%$ | $22 \%$ | $6 \%$ | $31 \%$ | 54\% |

${ }^{1}$ For this cycle, two LTI plans existed (with different metrics): LTPP (75\% NCVA, 25\% Innovation) and LTRPP (100\% rTSR), which merged into one plan from 2021. Payout represents the average CEO weighted payout.
${ }^{2}$ The starting share price and ending share price for the TSR measure are calculated as the average of the closing share prices over the 3 months prior to December 31, with the closing prices of all trading days equally weighted to derive the average.

The Board of Directors reviewed the overall 2024 incentive outcomes against the performance of the company, acknowledging the period of uncertainty at the time the targets were set, and decided that pay and performance are well aligned. As with prior years, it decided that no adjustments were required and did not apply any discretion to the 2022-2024 LTPP payout.

# CEO and Executive Committee 2024 compensation at grant

In accordance with the Swiss Code of Obligations, Novartis discloses total compensation at grant value for the CEO and Executive Committee.

The table below provides the following compensation information for the CEO, the CFO and the Presidents of our International and US organizations individually, while for all other ECN target pay is aggregated:

- 2024 base salary
- Actual cash portion and portion deferred in equity of the 2024 Annual Incentive
- 2024-2026 LTPP cycle awards, which are reported at target grant date value, based on the assumption that the awards will vest at 100\% achievement, excluding any share price movement and dividend equivalents that may be accrued over the performance cycle. The future payout will be determined only after the performance cycle concludes in three years (i.e., at the end of 2026), with a performance factor of $0 \%$ to $200 \%$ of the target value
- Other payments for 2024, which include other benefits, either paid in cash or granted in equity during the year
- 2024 pension benefits
- Total 2024 and total 2023 compensation at grant, for comparative purposes

The highest-paid individual in 2024 was Vasant Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis. The CEO 2024 compensation at grant increased compared with 2023 mainly due to the CEO LTPP target increase from 325\% to 400\%, effective 2024-2026 LTPP cycle, as communicated in the 2023 Compensation Report, which received strong support from shareholders. The compensation at grant for all Executive Committee members is lower compared with 2023 (CHF 62887204 versus CHF 68365 598) mainly due to a reduction in the number of members reported (in 2023, one member stepped down, compared with none in 2024).

# CEO and Executive Committee compensation philosophy and system 

## Compensation philosophy

Our compensation philosophy aims to ensure that we attract and retain outstanding Executive Committee members and reward them according to their success in implementing the Company strategy, as well as their contribution to Company performance and long-term value creation. The main elements of our compensation philosophy are set out in the table below.

| Pay for performance | - Variable compensation is tied directly to the achievement of strategic Company targets |
| :--: | :--: |
| Shareholder alignment | - Our incentives are significantly weighted toward long-term equity-based plans <br> - Measures under the Long-Term Incentive plans are calibrated to promote the creation of shareholder value <br> - Executive Committee members are expected to build and maintain substantial shareholdings |
| Balanced rewards | - Balanced set of measures to create sustainable value <br> - Mix of targets based on financial metrics, strategic objectives, and performance versus our competitors |
| Business ethics | - The Novartis Values and Behaviors are an integral part of our compensation system <br> - They underpin the assessment of overall performance for the Annual Incentive |
| Competitive compensation | - Total compensation must be sufficient to attract and retain key global talent <br> - Overarching emphasis on pay for performance |

## Approach to market benchmarking

Significant competition continues to exist for top executive talent with deep expertise and the requisite competencies and proven performance within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. For this reason, external peer compensation data is one of a number of key reference points considered by the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee when making
decisions on executive pay, to help ensure that the compensation system and levels at Novartis remain competitive. Novartis is committed to transparency in its benchmarking practices, including the disclosure of its healthcare peer group to shareholders on an annual basis.

The Compensation Committee believes in a rigorous approach to peer group construction and maintenance. Furthermore, it believes that using a consistent set of global peers that is similar to Novartis in size and scope of operations enables shareholders to evaluate compensation year on year and make pay-for-performance comparisons.

Although Novartis is headquartered in Switzerland, more than a third of its sales come from the US market, and the US therefore represents a significant talent pool for the recruitment of executives by the Company. The Compensation Committee uses a pay comparator group of global healthcare companies to ensure that Novartis is able to attract and retain key talent globally. To ensure European and local practices are fully taken into account, the Compensation Committee also uses a cross-industry peer group of Europe-headquartered multinational companies of a similar size and scope. Following an extensive review in 2024, both peer groups remain unchanged compared with 2023.

# Components of CEO and Executive Committee compensation 

The compensation of the CEO and Executive Committee is comprised of fixed pay, including an annual base salary, pension and other benefits, in addition to a variable annual incentive and long-term incentive, which are entirely performance based.

## Fixed pay and benefits

## Annual base salary

- The annual base salary is based on the individual's role, skills and experience. It is reviewed on an annual basis based on an external benchmark for the role, the performance of the individual, business performance and the external environment, salary increases across the Company and market movements.

Pension and other benefits
Pension and other benefits are provided to the Executive Committee members on the same terms as to all other employees based on local country practices and regulations. No supplementary pension plans or savings plans are provided.

- Pension and other benefits do not constitute a significant proportion of total compensation.
- Globally the Company operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans (see also Note 24 to the Company's consolidated financial statements).
- Novartis may provide other benefits according to local market practice. These include the provision of a company car, tax and financial planning, and insurance benefits.


## 2024 Annual Incentive

## PLAN OVERVIEW

| Target Annual Incentive | Annual base salary | $x$ | Target incentive \% | $=$ | Target <br> Annual Incentive |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| On-target opportunities | - CEO: 150\% of annual base salary. <br> - Other Executive Committee members: 80\% to 120\% of annual base salary. |  |  |  |  |
| Performance measures | - An Annual Incentive balanced scorecard containing: <br> - Financial performance measures ( $60 \%$ weighting) related to the Company <br> - Strategic objectives ( $40 \%$ weighting). <br> - The balanced scorecard targets and achievements of the CEO are detailed in " -2024 CEO Annual Incentive balanced scorecard." <br> - The balanced scorecards for individual Executive Committee members include the same company financial targets ( $60 \%$ weighting) as well as individual qualitative and quantitative targets ( $40 \%$ weighting). <br> - Values and Behaviors are a key component of the Annual Incentive and are embedded in our culture. As such, members of the Executive Committee are expected to demonstrate these to the highest standards. |  |  |  |  |
| Target setting | - Financial targets are set at the beginning of each financial year and align with the strategic plan proposed by management to the Board of Directors for approval. <br> - The strategic objectives are aligned with the most important priorities in any performance year. |  |  |  |  |
| Payout ranges | - The payout schedule for the Annual Incentive incorporates performance against financial and strategic objectives. The payout range is $0 \%$ to $200 \%$ of on-target opportunity based on performance, as shown below. |  |  |  |  |
|  | PERFORMANCE |  | PAYOUT (\% of on-target) |  |  |
|  | Outstanding |  | $170 \%-200 \%$ |  |  |
|  | Exceeds expectations |  | $130 \%-160 \%$ |  |  |
|  | Meets expectations |  | $80 \%-120 \%$ |  |  |
|  | Partially meets expectations |  | $40 \%-70 \%$ |  |  |
|  | Below expectations |  | $0 \%$ |  |  |


| Payout formula | Annual base salary | $x$ | Target incentive \% | $x$ | Payout factor (\% of target: $0 \%-200 \%)$ | $=$ | Realized <br> Annual Incentive |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Payout vehicle | - At the end of the performance period, 50\% is paid in cash, and the remaining 50\% is delivered in Novartis equity (restricted shares or RSUs) deferred for three years. If the shareholding requirement is met, the portion of the Annual Incentive that is mandatorily deferred in equity is reduced to 30\%. <br> - Executives may choose to receive all or part of the cash portion of their Annual Incentive in Novartis shares or American Depositary Receipts (ADRs; US only) that will not be subject to forfeiture conditions. In the US, awards may also be delivered in cash under the US deferred compensation plan. |  |  |  |  |  |
| Dividend rights, voting rights and settlement | - Novartis restricted shares and ADRs carry voting rights and dividends during the vesting period. <br> - RSUs are of equivalent value but do not carry voting rights and dividends during the vesting period. Following the vesting period, settlement of RSUs is made in unrestricted Novartis shares or ADRs. |  |  |  |  |  |


### Page 87 ###

# PLAN OVERVIEW 

| Award vehicle | Performance share units (PSUs) are granted at the beginning of the three-year performance cycle and vest at the end of the cycle to the extent that performance conditions have been met. At the time of vesting, they are converted into Novartis shares. <br> PSUs carry dividend equivalents that are paid in shares at the end of the cycle. |

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Target opportunity - CEO: $325 \%$ of annual base salary

- Other Executive Committee members: between 180\% and 260\% of annual base salary

Performance measures - Third-party sales CAGR (25\%)

- Core operating income CAGR (25\%)
- Innovation (25\%)
- Relative TSR (25\%)

Target setting Financial targets: Targets for third-party sales CAGR and core operating income CAGR are set based on the three-year strategic plan of the Company.
Innovation: Development targets are based on targeted filings communicated at the start of each threeyear performance cycle, weighted 70\%. For cycle 2022-2024, Biomedical Research targets consider the expected Net Present Value (eNPV) of programs transitioning to late-stage clinical development. Effective 2024-2026 LTPP cycle, given the earlier involvement from our commercial and strategy and growth business areas, all projects transitioning to late-stage clinical development have strategic value and are therefore scored equally.

Payout range Financial targets: When assessing performance, achievements for threshold, target and maximum payout are defined for each metric, and a payout curve is applied to determine the corresponding payout between 0-200\% against target.
Innovation: At the end of the cycle, the Compensation Committee determines, following input from the STC, the payout factor based on the number of relevant clinical milestones achieved against the target score. Relative TSR: Performance on TSR is assessed relative to our global healthcare peer group, as outlined below. A three-month averaging method is used for both the start and the end of the performance cycle. Companies are then ranked in order of highest to lowest TSR in USD. No payout for below median TSR applies.

| Global healthcare peer group |  |  | Novartis position in the peer group | Payout range (\% of target) |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| AbbVie | Eli Lilly \& Co | Novo Nordisk | Position 1 - 2 | $170 \%-200 \%$ |
| Amgen | Gilead Sciences | Pfizer | Position 3 - 5 | $130 \%-160 \%$ |

The Board of Directors may use its discretion on each metric, including deciding on the payout within the ranges where appropriate. In doing so, it takes into consideration factors such as the underlying assumptions of the targets set at the beginning of the cycle, overall economic conditions, currency fluctuations and other unforeseeable situations.

# CEO and Executive Committee share ownership requirements 

CEO and Executive Committee members are required to own a minimum multiple of their annual base salary in Novartis equity as set out in the table below. The Compensation Committee reviews compliance with the share ownership guideline on an annual basis.

| Function | Ownership level | Additional holding requirements | Time for achieving level | Equity included in determination |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| CEO | 6 x annual base salary | Equity vesting under the LTPP for a minimum of two years after the vesting date | Within five years of hire or promotion. <br> In the event of a substantial rise or drop in the share price, the Board of Directors may, at its discretion, amend the time period accordingly. | - Vested and unvested Novartis shares or ADRs, and RSUs acquired under Novartis compensation plans (unvested PSUs excluded) <br> - Other shares and vested options of Novartis shares or ADRs that are owned directly or indirectly by "Persons closely linked" to an Executive Committee member |

## CEO and Executive Committee: appointments

ELEMENT OF COMPENSATION POLICY

| Level | The overall package should be market-competitive to enable the recruitment of global executive talent with deep expertise and competencies. <br> The Compensation Committee may appoint individuals who are new to a role on an annual base salary (and/or incentives) that is below the market level, with a view to increase this toward market level over a period of three to four years as an individual develops in the role. <br> If the scope of an existing Executive Committee member's role changes significantly during the year, the Compensation Committee may make adjustments to the individual's base salary (and/or incentives) in consideration of the benchmark of the new role and the Executive Committee appointments compensation policy. |
| :--: | :--: |
| Annual base salary | This prudent approach ensures pay levels are merit-based, with increases dependent on strong performance and proven ability in the role over a sustained period. |
| Incentives | The compensation package will normally include the key compensation elements and incentive opportunities in line with those offered to current Executive Committee members. <br> In exceptional circumstances, higher incentive opportunities than those offered to current Executive Committee members may be provided at the Compensation Committee's discretion. <br> Performance measures may include business-specific measures tailored to the specific role. |
| Pension and other benefits | Newly appointed Executive Committee members are eligible for the local country pension plan and other benefits in line with the wider employee group. |
| Buyouts | The Compensation Committee seeks to balance the need to offer competitive compensation opportunities to acquire the talent required by the business with the principle of maintaining a strong focus on pay for performance. <br> As such, when an individual forfeits variable compensation as a result of an appointment at Novartis, the Compensation Committee may offer replacement awards to compensate the commercial equivalent value or fair value of payments and awards forfeited by the individual, in such form as the Compensation Committee considers appropriate, taking into account relevant factors. <br> Relevant factors include the expected value of the forfeited award, the replacement vehicle (i.e., cash, restricted share units, restricted shares or performance share units), whether the award is contingent on meeting performance conditions or not, the timing of forfeiture (i.e., Novartis mirrors the blocking or vesting period of the forfeited award) and the leaver conditions, in case the recruited individual leaves Novartis prior to the end of the blocking or vesting period. |
| International mobility | If individuals are required to relocate or be assigned away from their home location to take up their position, relocation support may be provided in line with our global mobility policies (e.g., relocation support, tax equalization). This includes ongoing US state income tax liabilities on behalf of US citizens locally employed outside the US who have US workdays and therefore, US state taxable compensation that generates a US state tax liability. |

# CEO and Executive Committee: termination arrangements 

| Elements | Retirement, termination by the Company for reasons other than performance or conduct, and change of control | Voluntary resignation | Termination by the Company for misconduct or poor performance | Death or long-term disability |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Annual Incentive for period between start of notice and termination date | Pro-rata Annual Incentive is paid to reflect the portion of the year the individual was employed. | Annual Incentive is fully forfeited. |  | Pro-rata Annual Incentive is paid to reflect the portion of the year the individual was employed. |
| Unvested equity: mandatory deferral of Annual Incentive into restricted shares/ restricted share units (RSUs) | Awards are released on the original blocking end date. Is subject to forfeiture in the event that a leaver joins a competitor company before the original vesting date. | Unvested restricted shares and restricted share units (RSUs) are forfeited. |  | Accelerated vesting is applied. |
| Unvested equity: voluntary deferral of Annual Incentive into restricted shares/RSUs/ American Depository Receipts (ADRs) (ADRs applicable for US employees only) |  | Awards are not subject to forfeiture during the deferral period. |  |  |
| Unvested equity: Long-Term Incentive performance share units (PSUs) | Awards vest on the regular vesting date, subject to performance, on a pro-rata basis for time spent with the Company during the performance cycle. Is subject to forfeiture in the event that a leaver joins a competitor company before the vesting date. | All of the award is forfeited. |  | Accelerated vesting at target is applied. |
| Unvested equity: Buyouts or previous equity grants in restricted shares/ restricted share units (RSUs) | Accelerated vesting is applied to equity pro-rated until last date of employment. | All of the award is forfeited. |  | Accelerated vesting is applied. |

Further details are provided in in our "—Risk Management principles."

## Malus and clawback policy

Any incentive compensation paid to Executive Committee members is subject to malus and clawback rules. This means that the Board of Directors for the CEO, and the Compensation Committee for the other Executive Committee members, may decide - subject to applicable law - to retain any unpaid or unvested incentive compensation (malus), or to recover incentive compensation
that has been paid or vested in the past (clawback). This applies in cases where the payout has resulted from a violation of laws or conflicts with internal management standards, including Company and accounting policies, as well as with US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule requirements.

This principle applies to both the short-term Annual Incentive and all long-term incentive plans.


### Page 90 ###

# CEO and Executive Committee performance management 

To foster a high-performance culture, the Company applies a performance management process based on quantitative and qualitative criteria. The CEO and the other Executive Committee members are subject to a formal threestep process, which consists of objective setting, performance evaluation and compensation determination. This process is explained in the chart below.

Performance targets are generally set before the start of the relevant performance cycle. A rigorous framework is in place for establishing targets to ensure they are suitably robust, challenging and aligned with the strategic priorities of the Company.
The key factors taken into account when setting targets include:

- Internal and external market expectations
- The strategic priorities of Novartis
- Regulatory factors (e.g., new launches, patent expiries)
- Investment in capital expenditure
- Novartis Values and Behaviors

The targets are challenged at multiple stages before they are ultimately approved by the Board of Directors. In line with good governance practices, the Compensation Committee works to set targets that are ambitious and challenging but do not encourage undue risk-taking.

Following the end of the performance cycle, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee consider performance against the targets originally set. The CEO and Executive Committee members are not present while the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee discuss their individual performance evaluations and determine their individual compensation. Prior to determining the final outcome, related factors such as performance relative to peers, wider market conditions, general industry trends and best practice are used to inform the overall performance assessment.

Objective setting

- The CEO proposes his targets to the Board Chair; they are then reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors.
- For other Executive Committee members, targets for their business units or functions are initially discussed with the CEO and subsequently approved by the Board of Directors.
- The CEO's performance against the individual balanced scorecard is assessed by the Board of Directors.
- For Executive Committee members, the CEO discusses each member's performance (assessed against their individual balanced scorecard) with the Board Chair before making recommendations to the Board of Directors for final determination.
- Periodic assessments, including at the mid-year stage, ensure progress is suitably tracked.
- A recommendation for the CEO's variable pay is made by the Compensation Committee to the Board of Directors for final determination.
- For the LTPP financial measures' payout schedules, a formulaic approach applies, and the Compensation Committee can also exercise judgment to ensure there is appropriate alignment between payout levels and overall performance achieved. The same principle of discretion applies to the relative TSR and innovation performance measures.
- The CEO's recommendations for other Executive Committee members are considered and approved by the Compensation Committee, after which the Board of Directors is notified of the outcomes.

# Executive Committee 2025 compensation 

Each year, we collaborate with our independent external advisors to benchmark the compensation levels of the Executive Committee members and assess the competitiveness of their total target compensation. 2025 compensation increases have been made after taking into account demonstrated performance and ability in role as outlined in "-CEO and Executive Committee: appointments." In accordance with our policy to increase total target compensation towards a more market competitive level over a period of three to four years as an individual develops in the role, we have made the following changes effective 2025:

## Victor Bulto, President, US

Mr. Bulto, appointed in April 2022, delivered strong results with significant overperformance across key brands and launches for Cosentyx HS, Fabhalta, Scemblix, and Kisqali. Mr. Bulto will receive a 3.5\% increase in annual base salary and a 30 ppts increase in LTPP target, as a percentage of annual base salary.

## Patrick Horber, President, International

Mr. Horber, appointed in December 2023, demonstrated notable successes across key International geographies, delivering nearly USD 1 billion sales above target. Mr. Horber will receive a $3.5 \%$ increase in annual base salary and a 30 ppts increase in LTPP target, as a percentage of annual base salary.

Following a strong performance, a further four Executive Committee members, who assumed their role in the last four years, will receive an increase in annual base salary between 1.6-6.0\%, and/or a 10 ppts increase in their Annual Incentive and/or LTPP target, as a percentage of annual base salary.

All other Executive Committee members, including the CEO, will receive ordinary base salary increases received by other employees in their country of employment ( $1.6 \%$ for Switzerland and 3.5\% for US), effective March 1, 2025. Their Annual Incentive and LTPP targets remain unchanged.

## Pay practice for other employees

The Board of Directors is committed to ensuring fair and competitive compensation practices across the entire organization. Recent such examples include an approved global budget of over USD 384 million for salary adjustments during 2025, maintaining our existing Equal Pay International Coalition (EPIC) and Living Wage commitments globally, starting a new global program to implement our renewed EPIC commitments in view of the EU Directive and expanding our all-employee share purchase plan which is now available to employees in over 50 countries globally. More details can be found in the Novartis in Society Integrated Report 2024.

# Board compensation philosophy and fee structure 

## Philosophy and benchmarking

Aligned with market practice in Switzerland, the Board of Directors sets compensation for its members at a level that allows for the attraction of high-caliber individuals, including both Swiss and international members, who have global experience.

Given their focus on corporate strategy, supervision and governance, Board members do not receive variable compensation. Each year at the AGM, shareholders are requested to approve, in a binding vote, the total compensation of the Board of Directors until the following AGM.

The Board of Directors sets the level of compensation for its Chair and other members to be in line with relevant benchmark companies, including other large Switzerland-based multinational companies such as ABB, Holcim, Nestlé, Richemont, Roche, Swiss Re, UBS and Zurich Insurance. This peer group, which remains the same as last year, was chosen due to the comparability of Swiss legal requirements, including broad personal and individual liabilities under Swiss law (and criminal liability under Swiss rules regarding board and executive committee compensation related to the Swiss Code of Obligations), and under US law, where applicable (due to the Company's secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange). To ensure independent deci-sion-making, the peer group used for the Board of Directors is different to that used for the Executive Committee. Each year, the Board of Directors reviews the compensation of its members, including the Board Chair, based on a proposal by the Compensation Committee and advice from its independent advisor, including relevant benchmarking information.

The Board Chair's contract and the Board of Directors compensation policy do not provide for any termi-nation-related payments.

## Share ownership requirements for Board members

To ensure their interests are aligned with those of shareholders the Board Chair is required to own a minimum of 30000 Novartis shares, and other members of the Board of Directors are required to own at least 5000 Novartis shares, within five years of having joined the Board of Directors.

Board members are prohibited from hedging or pledging their ownership positions in Novartis shares that are part of their guideline share ownership requirement and are required to maintain this requirement for 12 months after having retired from the Board of Directors. As at December 31, 2024, all current and former
members of the Board of Directors who were required to meet the minimum share ownership requirements did so.

## Board fee structure

The AGM 2024-2025 annual fee rates for Board membership and additional functions are included in the table below. These were approved by the Board of Directors and remain unchanged from the prior term. Aggregate Board compensation is aligned with other large Swiss companies.

Board members receive only fixed compensation and do not receive additional fees for attending meetings. Fees paid are at least 50\% in Novartis shares (up to 100\% at the choice of each Board member) and the remainder is paid in cash. Board members bear the full cost of their employee social security contributions, if any.

For 2024, the Board Chair voluntarily waived the increase in compensation to which he is contractually entitled.
AGM 2024-2025 annual fee CHF 000s
Board Chair ..... 3800
Board membership ..... 280
Vice-Chair ..... 50
Lead Independent Director ..... 20
Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee ..... 130
Chair of the Compensation Committee ..... 90

Membership of the Audit and Compliance Committee ..... 70
Membership of the following committees:
- Compensation Committee
- Governance, Nomination and Corporate Responsibilities Committee
- Science \& Technology Committee
- Risk Committee ..... 40

Board members do not receive any company pension, insurance or other benefits, unless mandated by local legislation. Novartis will pay mandatory employer contributions for the incoming Board Chair as required by law, should his nomination be approved at the 2025 AGM.

## AGM 2025-2026 changes

The Board of Directors approved an annual Board Chair compensation of CHF 3.5 million effective from the 2025 AGM, which is in line with our peer group median. No further changes will be made to the Board fees from the 2025 AGM to the 2026 AGM.

# Compensation governance 

## Legal framework

The Swiss Code of Obligations and the corporate governance guidelines of the SIX Swiss Exchange require listed companies to disclose certain information about the compensation of board and executive committee members, their equity participation, and loans made to them. This Annual Report fulfills that requirement in addition to being in line with the principles of the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance of the Swiss Business Federation (economiesuisse). For more information, see "-Corporate Governance" in Section 6C of this Annual Report.

## Compensation decision-making authorities

Authority for decisions related to compensation is governed by the Articles of Incorporation, Board Regulations and the Compensation Committee Charter, which are all published on the Company website: www.novartis.com/ investors/company-overview/corporate-governance. The Compensation Committee serves as the supervisory and governing body for compensation policies and plans within Novartis, and has overall responsibility for determining, reviewing and proposing compensation policies and plans for approval by the Board of Directors in line with the Compensation Committee Charter. The discussions and conclusions of each committee meeting are delivered to the full Board of Directors. A summary of the compensation decision-making authorities is set out below.

## Committee member independence

The Compensation Committee is composed exclusively of members of the Board of Directors who meet the independence criteria set forth in the Board Regulations. From the 2024 AGM, the Compensation Committee consisted of the following four members: Simon Moroney (as Chair), Patrice Bula, Bridgette Heller, and William Winters. William Winters will step down from the Board and Compensation Committee at the 2025 AGM. John Young will be proposed for nomination to the Compensation Committee at the 2025 AGM.

## Role of the Compensation Committee's independent advisor

The independent external compensation advisor supports the Compensation Committee in determining the design and implementation of compensation and benefits.

In 2024, the Compensation Committee retained Mitul Shah of Deloitte LLP, who was appointed in July 2022, as its independent compensation advisor. The independent advisor from Deloitte LLP and his respective team that advised and supported the Compensation Committee are not responsible or rewarded for work on senior compensation beyond support provided to the Compensation Committee and the People \& Organization function.

## Meetings held in 2024 and selfevaluation

In 2024, the Compensation Committee held six formal meetings. For the approval of the Board of Directors, in line with prior years, it collaborated with the Science \& Technology Committee to review and endorse the innovation targets and achievements of the 2024 Annual Incentive and the 2022-2024 LTPP. The Compensation Committee conducted a self-evaluation in 2024.

## Risk management principles

The Compensation Committee, with support from its independent compensation advisor, reviews market trends in compensation, and changes in corporate governance rules and best practices. Together with the Risk Committee, it also reviews the Novartis compensation systems to ensure that they do not encourage inappropriate or excessive risk-taking, and instead encourage behaviors that support sustainable value creation. A summary of the risk management principles is outlined below.

## RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

- Rigorous performance management process, with approval of targets and evaluation of performance of the CEO by the Board of Directors
- Balanced mix of short-term and long-term variable compensation elements
- Novartis Values and Behaviors are a key component of the Annual Incentive and are embedded in our culture
- Clawback and malus principles apply to all elements of the variable compensation
- Performance-vesting LongTerm Incentives only, with three-year cycles
- All variable compensation is capped at $200 \%$ of target
- Contractual notice period of 12 months
- Post-contractual non-compete period is limited to a maximum of 12 months from the end of employment. Resulting compensation, if applicable, will not exceed the average annual compensation (annual base salary plus Annual Incentive) of the previous three financial years
- Good and bad leaver provisions apply to variable compensation of leavers
- No severance payments or change-of-control clauses
- Share ownership requirements; no hedging or pledging of Novartis share ownership
- No loans granted to current or former members of the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors or to "Persons closely linked" to them (audited)

# Mandates outside the Novartis Group 

According to article 34 of the Articles of Incorporation (https://www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/ corporate-governance), limitations apply to mandates outside the Novartis Group for Board members and Executive Committee members (see "-Item 6.C Board Practices-Board of Directors-Mandates outside the Novartis Group" and "-Item 6.C Board Practices-Executive Committee-Mandates outside the Novartis Group"). The following external mandates are subject to these limitations and are therefore presented in the Compensation Report.

# Report of the statutory auditor 

To the General Meeting of Novartis AG, Basel

## Report on the Audit of the Compensation Report

## Opinion

We have audited the Compensation Report of Novartis AG (the Company) for the year ended December 31, 2024. The audit was limited to the information pursuant to Art. 734a-734f of the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO) in the tables marked "audited" on page 75, pages 77 to 80, pages 88 to 89 , and pages 92 to 93 of the Compensation Report.

In our opinion, the information pursuant to Art. 734a-734f CO in the accompanying Compensation Report complies with Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation.

## Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the "Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Compensation Report" section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Other Information

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the tables marked "audited" in the Compensation Report, the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements and our auditor's reports thereon.

Our opinion on the Compensation Report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the Compensation Report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the audited financial information in the Compensation Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Compensation Report

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of a Compensation Report in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of a Compensation Report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is also responsible for designing the Compensation system and defining individual Compensation packages.

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Compensation Report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information pursuant to Art. 734a-734f CO is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this Compensation Report.


### Page 99 ###

As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the Compensation Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.

We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

Article 5, paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that to be registered with voting rights, shareholders must declare that they acquired the shares in their own name and for their own account. According to article 5, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation, the Board may register nominees with the right to vote. The Share Register is a non-public register subject to statutory confidentiality and data privacy.

The Articles of Incorporation are available at www. novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corpo-rate-governance.

## REGISTRATION RESTRICTIONS

Article 5, paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that no shareholder shall be registered with the right to vote for more than $2 \%$ of the share capital. Given that shareholder representation at General Meetings has traditionally been comparatively low in Switzerland, Novartis AG considers registration restrictions necessary to prevent a minority shareholder from dominating a General Meeting. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption. Considerations include if the shareholder supports our goal of creating sustainable value and has a long-term investment horizon. Exemptions are in force for the registered shareholders listed in "Item 6.C Board practices-Group structure and share-holders-Shareholders-Significant shareholders." An exemption also applies to Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), Oslo, which as of December 31, 2024, was not registered but held $2.3 \%$ according to a disclosure notification filed with Novartis AG. No further exemptions were requested in 2024. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders.

Article 5, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that no nominee shall be registered with the right to vote for more than $0.5 \%$ of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction if the nominee discloses the names, addresses and number of shares of the persons for whose account it holds $0.5 \%$ or more of the registered share capital. Exemptions are in force for the nominees listed in "-Item 6.C Board practices-Group structure and shareholders-Shareholders-Significant shareholders," and for the nominee Citibank, London, which in 2015 requested an exemption, but as of December 31, 2024, was not registered in the Share Register. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders.


### Page 106 ###

According to article 5, paragraph 4 of the Articles of Incorporation, shareholders, ADR holders, or nominees who are linked to each other or who act in concert to circumvent registration restrictions are treated as one person or nominee for the purposes of the restrictions on registration.

The registration restrictions may be changed by resolution of the General Meeting, with approval of at least two-thirds of the votes represented at the meeting.

The Articles of Incorporation are available at www. novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corpo-rate-governance.

## ATTENDANCE, REPRESENTATION AND WEB PORTAL

Registered shareholders will receive a personal invitation letter to the General Meetings with an access code to log in to our web portal, and - if the shareholder did not use the web portal in the past - a printed invitation brochure and a registration/proxy form. By returning the registration/proxy form or using the web portal, shareholders can order an admission ticket for the General Meeting or appoint a representative of their choice by means of a written proxy or the Independent Proxy to vote their shares on their behalf.

If the Independent Proxy is appointed, shareholders can also give voting instructions on agenda items or on alternative or additional motions related to the agenda items either (i) following the recommendations of the Board for such alternative or additional motions; or (ii) opposing such alternative or additional motions. They can also abstain from voting.

## ADR HOLDERS

ADR holders have the rights enumerated in the deposit agreement (such as the right to give voting instructions and to receive dividends). The ADS depositary of Novartis AG - JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., New York holds the shares underlying the ADRs and is registered as a shareholder in the Share Register. An ADR is not a share, and an ADR holder is not a Novartis AG shareholder. Each ADR represents one share. ADR holders exercise their voting rights by instructing the depositary to exercise their voting rights. The ADS depositary exercises the voting rights for registered shares underlying ADRs for which no voting instructions have been given by providing a discretionary proxy to an uninstructed independent designee. Such designee must be a shareholder.

## Annual General Meeting (AGM)

## CONVENING

The AGM must be held within six months of the end of our financial year (December 31), and normally takes place in late February or early March. According to article 12a of the Articles of Incorporation (www.novartis.com/investors/ company-overview/corporate-governance), the Board may foresee that shareholders who cannot be present at the venue of the AGM may exercise their rights through electronic means. The Board may at any time until June 30, 2028' also order that the AGM be held electronically without a venue. Extraordinary General Meetings may be requested by the Board, the external auditor, or shareholders representing at least 5\% of the share capital.

## AGENDA

Shareholders representing shares with an aggregate nominal value of at least CHF 1 million may request that an item be included in a General Meeting agenda. Such requests must be made in writing at least 45 days before the meeting, specifying the requested item and proposal. If an explanatory statement is to be included in the notice of meeting, it must be submitted within the same period, and formulated in a short, clear and concise manner.

## POWERS

According to article 17 of the Articles of Incorporation (www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corpo-rate-governance), the following powers are vested exclusively in the General Meeting:

- Adoption and amendment of the Articles of Incorporation
- Election and removal of the Board Chair, the Board and Compensation Committee members, the Independent Proxy and the external auditor
- Approval of the management report, the consolidated financial statements and the report on non-financial matters
- Approval of the financial statements of Novartis AG, and the decision on the appropriation of available earnings shown on the balance sheet, in particular with regard to dividends (including any repayment of the statutory capital reserves and the approval of interim dividends and the interim financial statements required for such purpose)
- Approval of the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board (from one AGM until the next AGM) and of the Executive Committee (for the financial year following the AGM). If the maximum aggregate amount of compensation already approved by the AGM is not sufficient to cover the compensation of newly appointed or promoted Executive Committee members, Novartis may use up to $40 \%$ of the amount last approved for the newly appointed or promoted Executive Committee members
- Discharge of Board and Executive Committee members
- Delisting of the shares of Novartis AG
- Decisions on other matters that are reserved by law or by the Articles of Incorporation (e.g., advisory vote on the Compensation Report) to the General Meeting

[^0]
[^0]:    1 In accordance with the statement by the Board issued on February 10, 2023, Novartis commits to submitting the corresponding authorization again to a shareholder vote at the 2025 Annual General Meeting, regardless of the time limitation stipulated in the Articles of Incorporation.


### Page 107 ###

## STATUTORY QUORUMS

The General Meeting passes resolutions and elections with an absolute majority of the votes represented at the meeting.

## Election and term of office

Board members (including the Board Chair) and Compensation Committee members are elected individually by shareholders at the General Meeting for a one-year term of office. The term of office expires at the end of the next AGM.

According to article 20, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation, a member shall not serve on the Board for more than 12 years. Under special circumstances and if deemed to be in the best interest of the Company, the Board may recommend exceptions to the shareholders (www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/cor-porate-governance).

The term limit supports our commitment to renew the Board on an ongoing basis and follows international best practice.

## Succession planning

The GSNC prepares and reviews succession plans for the Board on an annual basis. These plans are discussed by the Board in private meetings. A search for a new Board member is launched - normally with the support of a professional executive search company - with individual selection criteria defined based on the evolving needs of the Company and a continuing focus on diversity, skills and experience. The set of competencies (further explained in "-Item 6.C Board practices-Board of Directors-Board skills") and a balance between continuity of experience and fresh perspectives are also important criteria for the GSNC when evaluating new candidates. Candidates are
interviewed by the Board Chair, members of the GSNC, other Board members, and members of the Executive Committee. The GSNC then makes a recommendation to the full Board, and the Board ultimately decides who should be proposed for election at the upcoming AGM.

## Independence

All Board members - including the Board Chair - are non-executive and independent, pursuant to applicable corporate governance rules and Novartis independence criteria, which are outlined in Appendix II to the Board Regulations (www.novartis.com/investors/com-pany-overview/corporate-governance). In particular, no Board member is or was a member of the management of Novartis AG or of any other Novartis Group company in the last three financial years up to December 31, 2024, or has or had, a significant business relationship with Novartis AG or with any other Novartis Group company.

The independence of Board members is assessed annually. Each Board member completes an independence questionnaire that is reviewed by the GSNC. The GSNC then submits a proposal to the full Board, and the Board determines the independence status of each Board member.

The Board members are also subject to procedures to avoid conflicts of interest which are outlined in the Board Regulations (www.novartis.com/investors/com-pany-overview/corporate-governance). Based on such procedures, Simon Moroney did not participate in any discussions regarding the acquisition of MorphoSys AG and did not have access to any underlying documents.


### Page 109 ###

## Diversity

Novartis is dedicated to fostering an inclusive Board where individuals from all genders and ethnic backgrounds can thrive and contribute their unique insights. A diverse Board ensures that the appropriate balance of skills, expertise, experience, and cultural background is represented to discharge its responsibilities and to support long-term value creation for shareholders, patients, employees and other stakeholders.

Diversity remains a critical focus area for the Board, and the GSNC continuously examines opportunities to
further increase the Board's diversity when identifying new Board member candidates. The GSNC considers gender, age, nationality, ethnicity and viewpoints, professional background, and expertise in its selection process.

Regarding gender diversity, the Board pledges to sustain its efforts to achieve $50 \%$ representation of both genders in the composition of the Board, within a range of $+/-10 \%$.

# Diversity profile

## Board skills

Upon proposal by the GSNC, the Board has determined a diverse set of competencies for its members that aligns with our status as a listed company, as well as our business portfolio, geographic reach and culture. Within this set of competencies, Board members were asked to identify their most relevant skills based on their educational background, professional experience and personal achievements.

The GSNC assesses the set of competencies as well as the individual skills annually to ensure that an appropriate balance of skills, expertise, experience and diversity is represented on the Board.

## Self-assessment

The Board and its committees conduct a self-assessment once a year, covering topics including Board composition, purpose, scope and responsibilities; succession planning; Board processes and governance; interaction between the Board and the Executive Committee; Board meetings and pre-reading material; team effectiveness; and Board Chair and peer evaluation. Every third year, this process is conducted by an independent external consultant.

The 2023 review was undertaken by the consulting firm Egon Zehnder and its results discussed with the Board of Directors and separately with the Executive Committee during the first half of 2024, where Egon Zehnder shared key observations and recommendations. The results of the 2023 in-depth assessment determined
that Novartis has a Board that is performing well and improving, where Directors are highly engaged and have a good rapport, and where there is effective succession and rejuvenation in place. Feedback from management on the Board's evaluation showed that the Executive Committee welcomes the interactions with the Board and its members, as well as the balanced supportive/ challenging dynamics and rich discussions. The report made several recommendations for the Board's consideration, including preparing for the transition to a new Board Chair in 2025 and areas where the Board should focus its attention in the future.

The 2024 self-assessment was conducted internally:

| Questionnaire | Review | Outcome |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| - Each Board member fills out an anonymous survey. <br> - A report identifying key strengths and challenges is produced for the Board and its committees. | - Based on the results, the Board Chair and the committee chairs each lead a qualitative review with their colleagues and then with the entire Board. <br> - In addition, the Vice-Chair leads a qualitative review of the Board Chair's performance, without the Chair being present, and then provides the Board Chair with the Board's feedback. | - The last self-assessment for 2024 determined that the Board and its committees are functioning effectively and efficiently. <br> - The feedback confirmed that the Board has an open culture, where different views are encouraged and respected, and that the Board is prepared to adapt and change as circumstances require. <br> - The results also identified key areas on which to focus, such as further development of Novartis strategy, sustained innovation and product pipeline, as well as the impact of the current geopolitical situation including US and China. The evaluation also showed that the Board has a key focus on supporting the Board Chair transition. |

## Trainings

The Board receives regular briefings and trainings on ethics, risks and compliance, ESG and other relevant topics. In 2024, each Board member completed training on the following:

- The US Healthcare Ecosystem, by Adam Fein
- Adverse event refresher
- Code of Ethics
- External partner risk management
- Antitrust / Fair Competition Policy updates
- "Fit to Commit", which focused on anti-bribery, insider trading, conflicts of interest and D\&I
- Data ethics and information management, covering key cybersecurity, information management and personal information risks, including AI use
Our Chief Legal Officer also provides regular updates to the Board members on developments related to insider trading laws and regulations and briefs members of the Board and the Executive Committee on an annual basis on their respective duties. In addition, the Company offers a broad range of external training to its Board members.


## Role of the Board and its committees

The Board is responsible for the overall direction and oversight of management, and holds the ultimate decision-making authority, with the exception of decisions reserved for shareholders. Board members are expected to commit the time and effort required to fulfil all their Board and committee responsibilities.

The Board has delegated certain duties and responsibilities to its five committees led by a Board-elected committee chair, as set out in the Board Regulations (www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/cor-porate-governance). In some cases, these responsibilities are of an advisory or preparatory nature. In other cases, the committee has decision-making power that is subject to final Board approval, or the responsibilities have been fully delegated to the committee. All committees have the authority to retain external consultants.

Any Board member may request a Board or committee meeting and the inclusion of an agenda item. Before meetings, Board members receive materials to help them prepare for the discussions and to inform decision-making.

# Information and control systems 

The Board's information and control systems vis-à-vis management include a steady flow of information from senior management; monthly financial reports; a comprehensive and integrated risk management framework; and the independent evaluation of our risk management and internal control framework by the Internal Audit function (see "Item 15. Controls and Procedures").

## Information from senior management

The Board ensures that it receives sufficient information from the Executive Committee through:

- Monthly CEO reporting (encompassing progress against company targets, including financial results) and frequent communications from the CEO on current developments
- Executive Committee meeting minutes
- Regular meetings and teleconferences by the Board and/or Board committees with the CEO and/or other members of the Executive Committee (e.g., the CFO, the Chief Legal Officer, the Chief Ethics, Risk \& Compliance Officer), and regular meetings and teleconferences with senior management (e.g., the Chief Audit Officer)
- Information from Executive Committee members or other Novartis employees, and visits to Novartis sites To obtain an outside view, the Board and/or Board committees occasionally invite external advisors (e.g., the independent advisor of the Compensation Committee, the external auditor) to attend a meeting and/or share their observations about a specific topic.


## Monthly financial reports

Novartis produces comprehensive, consolidated (unaudited) financial statements on a monthly basis for the Company. These are typically available no more than 10 days after the end of the month, and include the following:

- Consolidated income statement of the month and year to date, in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, as well as adjustments to arrive at core results that are not aligned with IFRS measures, as defined by Novartis (see "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Pros-pects-Item 5.A Operating results-Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis"). The IFRS Accounting Standards and core figures that are not aligned with IFRS measures are compared with the prior-year period and targets in both USD and on a constant currency basis.
- Supplementary data on a monthly and year-to-date basis, such as free cash flow and earnings per share on a USD basis

Management information related to the consolidated income statements and free cash flow is made available to Board members through the monthly CEO Report, which includes an analysis of key deviations from the prior year or target.

Prior to the release of each quarter's results, the Board receives the actual consolidated financial statement information and an outlook of the full-year results in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and core results that are not aligned with IFRS measures (as defined by Novartis), together with related commentary.

Annually, during the third quarter, the Board approves the Company's strategic plan for the next three years. In the fourth quarter of the year, the Board approves the operating targets for the following year as well as the financial targets for the following three-year period, including a projected consolidated income statement in USD prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis (core results).

The Board does not have direct access to the Novartis financial and management reporting systems but can, at any time, request more detailed information.

## Risk management

## Overview

At Novartis, our continued success depends on our ability to manage risk. Our Board has ultimate oversight of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system and regularly reviews the most significant risks and how these are managed. As explained below, the Board is supported by its committees. Furthermore, our Internal Audit function provides an independent evaluation of risk management (see "-Item 6.C Board practices-Information and control systems-Internal Audit").

## BOARD COMMITTEES

## RISK COMMITTEE

- Oversees the risk management system and processes
- Reviews, together with management, the prioritization and handling of risks, the risk portfolio, and actions implemented by management
- Performs deep dives into key risk areas and fosters a culture of smart risk-taking
- Receives updates on cyber security on an annual basis
- Receives regular updates from designated risk owners as well as the Chief Ethics, Risk \& Compliance Officer and/or the Head of Corporate Ethics, Risk \& Compliance


## AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE

- Works closely with the Risk Committee to minimize gaps in risk coverage
- Receives a semiannual presentation from the Chief Ethics, Risk \& Compliance Officer
- Receives a quarterly presentation from the Chief Audit Officer on progress achieved in implementing the risk-based audit plan, and key insights about audit and advisory activities
- Pays particular attention to financial risk
- Has closed sessions with the Chief Audit Officer and, upon request, with the Chief Ethics, Risk \& Compliance Officer


## COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

- Works closely with the Risk Committee to ensure that the compensation system does not lead to excessive risk-taking (see "-Item 6.B Compensation-Compensation governanceRisk management principles")


## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF NOVARTIS

- Regularly assesses risks and fosters a culture of risk awareness, in line with the Novartis Values and Behaviors and the Novartis Code of Ethics


## ETHICS, RISK \& COMPLIANCE

- Governs the Novartis Code of Ethics
- Provides an integrated ERM framework (which is described in the following section)
- Governs the global compliance program within Novartis
- Administers the Enterprise Policy Management and global Internal Controls framework

SENIOR LEADERS OF ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS AND GLOBAL FUNCTIONS, AT ALL LEVELS

- Provide appropriate risk management within their area of responsibility
- Establish adequate risk prevention and mitigation strategies when risk exposure is identified, including tracking progress and providing resources for possible actions
- Assess emerging risks, trends and overall exposure as part of the ERM process


## Enterprise Risk Management framework

The Ethics, Risk \& Compliance (ERC) function provides an integrated ERM framework to obtain a holistic view of Company risks and drive a culture of smart risk-taking. Under the leadership of the Chief Ethics, Risk \& Compliance Officer, the Corporate ERC team is responsible for the overall ERM process which is a fundamental pillar of our Integrated Assurance. This process covers, but is not limited to, risks associated with:

- The research, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of products
- Finance, taxes, intellectual property, compliance with law and regulations, security, product safety, technology, human resources, and health, safety and environmental protection
- Business objectives and strategies, including mergers and acquisitions
- External factors (e.g. risk amplifiers) such as the social, political and economic environment

The ERM process continued to evolve in 2024. The Corporate ERC team conducted risk workshops and collaborated with all risk assurance and monitoring functions to identify key risks across the Company. Each Novartis unit organized a focused risk workshop including leadership team members. In parallel, risk workshops were held in top countries by revenue and in certain focus markets. Once key risks were identified, mitigation action plans were created to address them in an effective way. The findings from these workshops were consolidated into the Novartis Risk Radar, which enables senior management, the Executive Committee and the Board to focus discussions on key risks and more closely align our corporate strategy with our risk exposure and ways of working.

In 2024, the Corporate ERC team further developed the ERM framework within the Novartis Corporate ERC organization. We developed additional risk management training and launched our risk intelligence forum, an event that brought together internal and external speakers to address emerging trends and threats. We also integrated a critical scope of activities (Trade Sanctions Governance) into the Corporate ERC team. Furthermore, steady progress has been made in our Integrated Assurance journey by creating a holistic control framework linked to enterprise policies, and by further strengthening our Corporate ERC Assurance team by integrating Labor Rights and Data Privacy External Partner Audits to ensure a harmonized and coordinated monitoring process across the Company.

## Internal Audit

## Internal Audit Purpose and Function

The Internal Audit function supports the Board and Executive Committee by providing independent assurance. It evaluates the effectiveness, efficiency, and adequacy of processes and controls, ensuring that Novartis meets its strategic objectives, manages major risks, and complies with applicable policies, laws, and regulations.

The Chief Audit Officer (CAO) reports administratively to the CEO and functionally to the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee (ACC). The CAO meets with the ACC at least quarterly and annually reaffirms the organizational independence of the Internal Audit function to the ACC.

In 2024, Internal Audit executed a risk-based audit plan, with results reported to audited units, the Executive Committee, and the ACC. Audit findings and action plans are centralized to ensure efficient follow-up. To the right is a summary of the audits and advisory activities conducted in 2024, along with key methodology steps for managing the Internal Audit cycle.

- Execution and Reporting: 37 engagements delivered in 2024, all linked to group risks, emerging topics and com-pany-wide initiatives.
- Follow Up: Management is responsible for resolving issues, supported by Internal Audit to ensure timely closure of high-risk observations.

Internal Audit performed 95\% of planned activities (equating to 76 of 80 engagements) in 2024.

# Auditors 

## Duration of the mandate and terms of office

On behalf of the Board, the ACC selects and nominates an independent auditor for election at the AGM. KPMG commenced its auditing mandate for Novartis in 2022. Richard Broadbelt, Auditor in charge, and Heidi BroomHirst, Global Audit Partner, began serving in their roles in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The ACC together with KPMG will ensure that these partners are rotated at least every five years.

## Auditing fees and additional fees

The ACC monitors and preapproves the fees paid to the external auditor for all audit and non-audit services. It has developed and approved a policy with clear guidelines on the engagement of the independent auditor firm. This policy is designed to help ensure that the independence of the external auditor is maintained. It limits the scope of services that the external auditor may provide to the Company, stipulating certain permissible types of audit-related and non-audit services, including tax services and other services that have been preapproved by the ACC. The ACC preapproves all other services on a case-by-case basis.

The external auditor is required to report periodically to the ACC about the scope of the services it has provided to the Company and the fees for the services it has performed to date. KPMG fees for professional services related to the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, are as follows:

|  | 2024 <br> USD million | 2023 <br> USD million |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Audit services | 25.3 | 26.8 |
| Audit-related services | 1.9 | 2.5 |
| Tax services | 0.1 | 0.3 |
| Other services | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Total | $\mathbf{2 7 . 3}$ | 29.6 |

Audit services include work performed to issue opinions on consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements of Novartis AG, to issue opinions related to the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, and to issue reports on local statutory financial statements. Also included are audit services that can generally only be provided by the statutory auditor, such as the audits of the Compensation Report, special purpose financial statement in connection with divestment transactions, information systems and the related control environment; and reviews of quarterly financial results.

Audit-related services include other assurance services provided by the independent auditor but not restricted to those that can only be provided by the statutory auditor. They include services such as: limited assurance on selected sustainability information in the Novartis in Society Integrated Report, audits of pension and other employee benefit plans; audit services in connection with non-recurring transactions; assurance of the Compensation Report of Novartis; and other audit-related services.

Tax services include tax compliance and assistance with historical tax matters.

Other services include license fees for use of accounting and other reporting guidance databases and, in 2024, additionally procedures related to training on emerging topics and benchmarking studies.

## Information to the Board and the ACC

The ACC, acting on behalf of the Board, is responsible for overseeing the activities of the external auditor. In 2024, this committee held seven meetings. KPMG was invited to all of these meetings to attend the discussions on auditing matters and any other matters relevant to its audit.

The ACC recommended to the Board to approve the audited consolidated financial statements and the separate parent company financial statements of Novartis AG for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Board proposed the acceptance of these financial statements for approval by the shareholders at the next AGM.

The ACC regularly evaluates the performance of the external auditor and, based on this, once a year determines whether the external auditor should be proposed to the shareholders for re-election. To assess the performance of the external auditor, the ACC requests input from management and holds private meetings with the CFO and the Chief Audit Officer and, if necessary, obtains an independent external assessment. Criteria applied for the performance assessment of the external auditor include an evaluation of: its technical and operational competence; its independence and objectivity; the sufficiency of the resources it has employed; its focus on areas of significant risk to Novartis; its willingness to probe and challenge; its ability to provide effective, practical recommendations; and the openness and effectiveness of its communications and coordination with the ACC, the Internal Audit function and management.

Once a year, the Auditor in charge and the Global Audit Partner report to the Board on the external auditor's activities during the current year, and on the audit plan for the coming year.

On an annual basis, the external auditor provides the ACC with written disclosures required by the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the committee and the external auditor discuss the external auditor's independence from Novartis.

Novartis shares are widely held.

Based on the Novartis Share Register and excluding treasury shares, approximately $56.5 \%$ of the shares registered by name were held in Switzerland, and approximately $23.9 \%$ were held in the US. Approximately $20.5 \%$ of the shares registered in the Share Register were held by individual investors, while approximately $45.1 \%$ were held by legal entities, excluding $9.7 \%$ of our share capital held as treasury shares by

Novartis AG or its fully owned subsidiaries (including Swiss foundations controlled by Novartis AG), and 34.4\% were held by nominees, fiduciaries and the ADS depositary.

Based on the Share Register, we believe that we are not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or government, or by any other natural or legal persons. There are no arrangements that may result in a change of control.

As December 31, 2024, the following shareholders held more than $5 \%$ of the total share capital of Novartis:

${ }^{2}$ This information is based solely on the Schedule 13G filed by BlackRock, Inc. on February 2, 2024 with the SEC.

As of December 31, 2024, no other shareholder held more than $5 \%$ of our share capital.

The Articles of Incorporation provide that no shareholder shall be registered with the right to vote shares comprising more than $2 \%$ of the registered share capital. The Board of Directors may, upon request, grant an
exemption from this restriction. See "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Item 6.C Board practices-Shareholder participation-Voting rights, restrictions and representation-Registration restrictions" for additional information.

See "Item 18. Financial Statements."

## Dividend policy

Subject to the dividend policy described below, our Board of Directors expects to recommend the payment of a dividend in respect of each financial year. If approved by our shareholders at the relevant annual shareholders' meeting, the dividends will be payable shortly following such approval. Any shareholder who purchases our shares before the ex-dividend date and holds the shares until that date shall be deemed to be entitled to receive the dividends approved at that meeting. Dividends are reflected in our financial statements in the year in which they are approved by our shareholders.

Our dividend policy is to pay a growing annual dividend in Swiss francs per share. This policy is subject to our financial conditions and outlook at the time, the results of our operations, and other factors.

The Board will propose a dividend of CHF 3.50 per share to the shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on March 7, 2025. Because we pay dividends in Swiss francs, exchange rate fluctuations will affect the US dollar amounts received by holders of ADRs. For the amount of dividends we paid in the past three years, see "Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 18. Equity."

## Disclosure pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act (ITRA)

At Novartis, our purpose is to reimagine medicine to improve and extend people's lives, regardless of where they live. This includes the compliant sale of medicines and other healthcare products worldwide. To help us fulfill this mission, we have for many years maintained a branch office located in Iran.

As of October 18, 2010, a non-US Novartis affiliate entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Pursuant to the MoU, the Iranian Ministry of Health acknowledges certain benefits that may apply to sales of certain of our medicines by third-party distributors in Iran. These include fast-track
registration, market exclusivity, end-user subsidies, and exemptions from customs tariffs. Novartis receives no payments from the Iranian Ministry of Health under the MoU, and the MoU creates no obligations on the part of either Novartis or the Iranian Ministry of Health.

From time to time, including in 2024, certain Novartis non-US affiliates made payments to government entities in Iran related to patents, trademarks and exit fees.

From time to time, including in 2024, certain Novartis non-US affiliates enter into agreements with hospitals, research institutes, medical associations and universities in Iran to provide grants and sponsor congresses, seminars and symposia, and with doctors and other healthcare professionals for consulting services, including participation in advisory boards and investigator services for observational (non-interventional) studies. Some hospitals and research institutes are owned or controlled by the government of Iran, and some doctors and healthcare professionals are employed by hospitals that may be public or government-owned.

Because we have operations in Iran, including employees, we obtain services and have other dealings incidental to our activities in that country, including paying taxes and salaries either directly or indirectly through a service provider, and obtaining office rentals, insurance, electricity, water and telecommunications services, office and similar supplies, and customs-related services from Iranian companies that may be owned or controlled by the government of Iran. In addition, from time to time, representatives of our non-US affiliates participate in meetings with Iranian officials to discuss issues relevant to our business and the pharmaceutical industry.

Certain Novartis non-US affiliates maintain local accounts at banks that are, as of November 5, 2018, on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List). These non-US affiliates make local transactions for employee payroll and local vendor payment purposes. These transactions are conducted for the purpose of facilitating the provision of medicine to Iran, in line with the humanitarian exceptions contained in Section 11 of Executive Order 13902 and other applicable sanctions legal authorities. No transactions are made with an Iranian financial institution designated on the SDN List in connection with Iran's support for international terrorism or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

# Item 10. Additional Information 

## 10.A Share capital

Not applicable.

## 10.B Memorandum and articles of association

The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation ("Articles"); the Board Regulations; and Swiss law, particularly the Swiss Code of Obligations ("Swiss CO"), and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Articles and the Board Regulations, which are an exhibit to the Form 20-F, and to Swiss law.

## 10.B. 1 Company purpose

Novartis AG is registered in the commercial register of the canton of Basel-Stadt, Switzerland, under number CHE-103.867.266. Our business purpose, as stated in Article 2 of the Articles, is to hold interests in enterprises in the area of healthcare or nutrition. We may also hold interests in enterprises in the areas of biology, chemistry, physics, information technology or related areas. We may acquire, mortgage, liquidate or sell real estate and intellectual property rights in Switzerland or abroad. In pursuing our business purpose, we strive to create sustainable value.

## 10.B. 2 Directors

According to our Articles, the Board of Directors ("Board") consists of a minimum of eight and a maximum of 16 members. The members of the Board (including the Board Chair) are elected individually by the General Meeting of Shareholders ("General Meeting") for a oneyear term of office lasting until the completion of the next Annual General Meeting of Shareholders ("AGM").
(a) A Board resolution requires the affirmative majority of the votes cast. According to our Board Regulations, a member of our Board ("Director") may not participate in decisions and resolutions on matters that affect, or reasonably might affect, the Director's interests or the interests of a person close to the Director (but the Director may participate in the discussion).
(b) Compensation of the Directors is subject to the approval of the aggregate amounts of such compensation by a shareholders' resolution under the Swiss CO.
(c) The Articles prohibit the granting of loans or credits to Directors.
(d) The Articles provide that a Director shall not serve on the Board for more than 12 years. The Board may, under certain circumstances and if deemed in the best interests of the Company, recommend exceptions to this rule to the General Meeting.
(e) Our Directors are not required to be shareholders at the time of the election by the General Meeting. However, according to our share ownership guidelines, to ensure their interests are aligned with those of our shareholders, the Board Chair is required to own a minimum of 30000 Novartis AG shares, and other Directors are required to own at least 5000 Novartis AG shares within five years of having joined the Board.

## 10.B. 3 Shareholder rights

Because Novartis AG has only one class of registered shares, the following information applies to all shareholders.
(a) Under the Swiss CO, we may only pay dividends out of balance sheet profits or out of distributable reserves. In any event, under the Swiss CO, while the Board may propose that a dividend be paid, we may only pay dividends upon shareholders' approval at a General Meeting. Furthermore, the Swiss CO requires us to accrue general legal reserves under certain circumstances so long as these reserves amount to less than $20 \%$ of our registered share capital, and Swiss law and the Articles permit us to accrue additional reserves beyond the statutory reserves. Our auditors must confirm that the dividend proposal of our Board conforms with the Swiss CO and the Articles. Our Board expects to recommend the payment of a dividend in respect of each financial year. See "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Item 6.C Board Practices-Capital Structure-Limitation on transferability-Per-share information" and "Item 8. Financial Information-Item 8.A. Consolidated statements and other financial informationDividend policy."

Dividends are usually due and payable shortly after the shareholders have passed a resolution approving the payment. Dividends that have not been claimed within five years after the due date revert to us and are allocated to our general reserves. For information about deduction of the withholding tax or other duties from dividend payments, see "-Item 10.E Taxation."


### Page 143 ###

(b) Each share is entitled to one vote at a General Meeting. Voting rights may only be exercised for shares registered with the right to vote on the record date for the applicable General Meeting. To do so, the shareholder must file a share registration form with us, setting forth the shareholder's name, address and citizenship (or, in the case of a legal entity, its registered office). If the shareholder has not timely registered its shares, then the shareholder may not vote at, or participate in, a General Meeting.

To vote its shares, the shareholder must also explicitly declare that it has acquired the shares in its own name and for its own account. If the shareholder refuses to make such a declaration, the shares may not be voted unless the Board recognizes such shareholder as a nominee.

The Articles provide that no shareholder shall be registered with the right to vote shares comprising more than $2 \%$ of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction. Considerations include whether the shareholder supports our goal of creating sustainable value and has a long-term investment horizon. Furthermore, the Articles provide that no nominee shall be registered with the right to vote shares comprising more than $0.5 \%$ of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction if the nominee discloses the names, addresses, and number of shares of the persons for whose account it holds $0.5 \%$ or more of the registered share capital. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders. We have in the past granted exemptions from the $2 \%$ rule for shareholders and the $0.5 \%$ rule for nominees.

For purposes of the $2 \%$ rule for shareholders and the $0.5 \%$ rule for nominees, groups of companies and groups of shareholders acting in concert are considered to be one shareholder. These rules also apply to shares acquired or subscribed by the exercise of subscription, option or conversion rights.

After hearing the registered shareholder or nominee, the Board may cancel, with retroactive effect as of the date of registration, the registration of the shareholders if the registration was effected based on false information.

Registration restrictions in the Articles may only be removed upon a resolution carrying a two-thirds majority of the votes represented at a General Meeting.

Except as noted below, shareholders' resolutions require the approval of an absolute majority of the votes present at a General Meeting. As a result, abstentions have the effect of votes against such resolutions. Some examples of shareholders' resolutions requiring a vote by such "absolute majority of the votes" are:

- Adoption and amendment of the Articles

Our shareholders are required, on an annual basis, to elect all Directors (including the Board Chair), the Compensation Committee members, the external auditor and the Independent Proxy. The Articles do not provide for cumulative voting of shares.

At a General Meeting, shareholders can be represented by a legal representative or, by means of a written proxy, by a representative of choice. Furthermore, a shareholder may be represented by the Independent Proxy. Votes are taken either by a show of hands or by electronic voting, unless the General Meeting resolves to have a ballot or where a ballot is ordered by the chair of the meeting. ADSs, each representing one Novartis AG share and evidenced by ADRs, are issued by our depositary JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., New York, and not by us. The ADR is vested with rights defined and enumerated in the Deposit Agreement (such as the rights to vote, to receive a dividend and to receive a share of Novartis AG in exchange for a certain number of ADRs). The enumeration of rights, including any limitations on those rights in the Deposit Agreement, is final. There are no other rights given to the ADR holders. Only the ADS depositary, holding our shares underlying the ADRs, is registered as shareholder in our share register. An ADR is not a Novartis AG share, and an ADR holder is not a Novartis AG shareholder.

The Deposit Agreement between our depositary, the ADR holder and us has granted certain indirect rights to vote to the ADR holders. ADR holders may not attend a General Meeting in person. ADR holders exercise their voting rights by instructing JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., our depositary, to exercise the voting rights attached to the registered shares underlying the ADRs. Each ADR represents one Novartis AG share. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., exercises the voting rights for registered shares underlying ADRs for which no voting instructions have been given by providing a discretionary proxy to an uninstructed independent designee. Such designee has to be a shareholder of Novartis AG. The same voting restrictions apply to ADR holders as to those holding Novartis AG shares (i.e., the right to vote up to $2 \%$ of the Novartis AG registered share capital - unless otherwise granted an exemption by the Board - and the disclosure requirement for nominees).
(c) Shareholders have the right to allocate the profit shown on our balance sheet and to distribute dividends by vote taken at the General Meeting, subject to the legal requirements described above.
(d) Under the Swiss CO, any surplus arising out of a liquidation of Novartis AG (i.e., after the settlement of all claims of all creditors) would be distributed to the shareholders in proportion to the paid-in nominal value of their shares.
(e) The Swiss CO limits a corporation's ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares if we have sufficient freely disposable equity in the amount of the purchase price of the acquired shares. The aggregate nominal value of all Novartis AG shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed $10 \%$ of our registered share capital. However, it is accepted that a Swiss corporation may repurchase its own shares
beyond the statutory limit of $10 \%$ if the repurchased shares are clearly earmarked for cancellation. In addition, we are required to recognize a negative position, or if our subsidiaries acquire our shares, to create a special reserve on our balance sheet in the amount of the purchase price of the acquired shares. Repurchased shares held by us or our subsidiaries do not carry any rights to vote at a General Meeting but are entitled to the economic benefits generally connected with the shares.

Under the Swiss CO, we may not cancel treasury shares without the approval of a capital reduction by our shareholders given that shareholders have not approved the introduction of a capital band.
(f) Not applicable.
(g) Since all of our issued and outstanding shares have been fully paid in, our shareholders are not obliged to make further contributions with respect to their shares.
(h) See "-Item 10.B.3(b) Shareholder rights" and "Item 10.B. 7 Change in control."

## 10.B. 4 Changes to shareholder rights

Under the Swiss CO, we may not issue new shares without the prior approval of a capital increase by our shareholders. If a capital increase is approved, then our shareholders would generally have certain pre-emptive rights to obtain newly issued shares in an amount proportional to the nominal value of the shares they already hold. These pre-emptive rights could be excluded in certain limited circumstances with the approval of a resolution adopted at a General Meeting by a supermajority of two-thirds of the votes. In addition, we may not create shares with increased voting powers or place restrictions on the transfer of registered shares without the approval of a resolution adopted at a General Meeting by a supermajority of votes. In addition, see "-Item 10.B.3(b) Shareholder rights" with regard to the Board's ability to cancel the registration of shares under limited circumstances.

## 10.B. 5 Shareholder meetings

Under the Swiss CO and the Articles, we must hold an AGM within six months after the end of our financial year. A General Meeting may be convened by the Board or, if necessary, by the external auditor. The Board is further required to convene an extraordinary General Meeting if so resolved by a General Meeting, or if so requested by shareholders by signed petition representing at least $5 \%$ of the share capital, specifying the items for the agenda and their proposals. Shareholders representing shares with an aggregate nominal value of at least CHF 1000000 may request that an item be included in a General Meeting agenda. A General Meeting is convened by publishing a notice in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce (Schweizerisches Handelsamtsblatt) at least 20 days prior to such meeting. Shareholders may also be informed by mail. Neither the Swiss CO nor the Articles require a quorum for a General Meeting. In addition, see "-Item 10.B.3(b) Shareholder rights" regarding conditions for exercising a shareholder's right to vote at a General Meeting.


### Page 145 ###

### 10.B.6 Limitations

There are no limitations under the Swiss CO or our Articles on the right of non-Swiss residents or nationals to own or vote shares other than the restrictions applicable to all shareholders and holders of ADRs described in "-Item 10.B.3(b) Shareholder rights."

## 10.B. 7 Change in control

The Articles and the Board Regulations contain no provision that would have an effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Novartis AG and that would operate only with respect to a merger, acquisition or corporate restructuring involving us or any of our subsidiaries.

According to the Swiss Merger Act, shareholders may pass a resolution to merge with another corporation at any time. Such a resolution would require the consent of at least two-thirds of all votes present at the necessary General Meeting.

Under the Swiss Financial Market Infrastructure Act, shareholders and groups of shareholders acting in concert who acquire more than $331 / 3 \%$ of our shares would be under an obligation to make an offer to acquire all remaining Novartis AG shares. Novartis AG has neither opted out from the mandatory takeover offer obligation nor opted to increase the threshold for mandatory takeover offers in its Articles.

## 10.B. 8 Disclosure of shareholdings

Under the Swiss Financial Market Infrastructure Act, persons who directly, indirectly or in concert with other
parties acquire or dispose of our shares or purchase or sale rights relating to our shares are required to notify us and the SIX of the level of their holdings whenever such holdings reach, exceed or fall below certain thresholds $-3 \%, 5 \%, 10 \%, 15 \%, 20 \%, 25 \%, 331 / 3 \%, 50 \%$ and $662 / 3 \%$ - of the voting rights represented by our share capital (whether exercisable or not). This also applies to anyone who has discretionary power to exercise voting rights associated with our shares. Following receipt of such notification, we are required to inform the public by publishing the information via the electronic publication platform operated by the SIX.

An additional disclosure obligation exists under rules of the SIX that requires us to disclose the identity of all of our shareholders (or related groups of shareholders) as published pursuant to the paragraph above, in Item 6.C of this Annual Report. See "Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Item 6.C Board prac-tices-Group structure and shareholders-Sharehold-ers-Significant shareholders."

## 10.B. 9 Differences in the law

See the references to Swiss law throughout this "Item 10.B Memorandum and articles of association."

## 10.B. 10 Changes in capital

The requirements of the Articles regarding changes in capital are not more stringent than the requirements of Swiss law.

# 10.C Material contracts 

## Sandoz Spin-Off

In connection with the spin-off of Sandoz, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated September 30, 2023, a Tax Matters Agreement, dated September 30, 2023 and several other agreements with Sandoz to effect the separation of the Sandoz business and provide a framework for our relationship with Sandoz after the spin-off.

The Separation and Distribution Agreement sets forth the parties' agreements regarding the principal actions to be taken in connection with the separation of the Sandoz business and the spin-off, by way of a distribution of shares of Sandoz Group AG by Novartis AG to Novartis shareholders, including the conditions of the spin-off and the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the separation and distribution. The Separation and Distribution Agreement identifies the assets to be transferred, liabilities to be assumed and contracts to be assigned to each of Novartis and Sandoz as part of the internal transactions effected prior to the
distribution and provides for when and how such transfers, assumptions and assignments should occur. Each party agreed to indemnify the other and each of the other's directors, officers, managers, members, agents and employees against certain liabilities incurred in connection with the spin-off and the parties' respective businesses (subject to certain exceptions).

The Tax Matters Agreement imposes certain restrictions and indemnity obligations on Sandoz designed to preserve the tax-neutral nature of the spin-off for Swiss tax and US federal income tax purposes.

The Tax Matters Agreement also provides that Sandoz will be liable for any taxes accruing in the ordinary course of business of Novartis and its subsidiaries before the spin-off if such taxes are attributable to entities which are transferred or allocated to the Sandoz Group as part of the spin-off, whereas Novartis will remain liable for any other taxes accruing before the spin-off in the ordinary course of business, to the extent not attributed to Sandoz.


### Page 146 ###

# 10.D Exchange controls 

There are no Swiss governmental laws, decrees or regulations that affect - in a manner material to Novartis AG - the export or import of capital, including the availability of cash and cash equivalents for use by Novartis or

any foreign exchange controls that affect the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non-residents or non-citizens of Switzerland who hold Novartis AG securities.

## 10.E Taxation

The taxation discussion set forth below is intended only as a descriptive summary and does not purport to be a complete analysis or listing of all potential tax effects relevant to the ownership or disposition of our shares or ADRs. The statements of US and Swiss tax laws set forth below are based on the laws and regulations in force as of the date of this 20-F-including the current Convention Between the US and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income, entered into force on December 19, 1997 (the Treaty); the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code); Treasury regulations; rulings; judicial decisions; and administrative pronouncements-and may be subject to any changes in US and Swiss law, and in any double taxation convention or treaty between the US and Switzerland occurring after that date, which changes may have retroactive effect.

## Swiss taxation

## Swiss residents

Withholding Tax on dividends and distributions. Dividends that we pay and similar cash or in-kind distributions that we may make to a holder of shares or ADRs (including distributions of liquidation proceeds in excess of the nominal value, stock dividends and, under certain circumstances, proceeds from repurchases of shares by us in excess of the nominal value) are generally subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax (the Withholding Tax) at a current rate of $35 \%$. Under certain circumstances, distributions out of capital contribution reserves made by shareholders after December 31, 1996, are exempt from the Withholding Tax. We are required to withhold Withholding Tax due from the gross distribution and to pay the Withholding Tax to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. The Withholding Tax is refundable in full to Swiss tax residents who are the beneficial owners of the taxable distribution at the time it is resolved and duly report the gross distribution received on their personal tax return or in their financial statements for tax purposes, as the case may be.

Income tax on dividends. A Swiss tax resident who receives dividends and similar distributions (including stock dividends and liquidation surplus) on shares or ADRs is required to include such amounts in the shareholder's personal income tax return. However,
distributions out of qualified capital contribution reserves are not subject to income tax. A corporate shareholder may claim substantial relief from taxation of dividends and similar distributions received if the shares held represent a fair market value of at least CHF 1 million.

Capital gains tax upon disposal of shares. Under current Swiss tax law, the gain realized on shares held by a Swiss resident who holds shares or ADRs as part of his private property is generally not subject to any federal, cantonal or municipal income taxation on gains realized on the sale or other disposal of shares or ADRs. However, gains realized upon a repurchase of shares by us may be characterized as taxable dividend income if certain conditions are met. Book gains realized on shares or ADRs held by a Swiss corporate entity or by a Swiss resident individual as part of the shareholder's business property are, in general, included in the taxable income of such person. However, the Federal Law on the Direct Federal Tax of December 14, 1990, and several cantonal laws on direct cantonal taxes provide for exceptions for Swiss corporate entities holding more than $10 \%$ of our voting stock for more than one year.

## Residents of other countries

Recipients of dividends and similar distributions on our shares who are neither residents of Switzerland for tax purposes nor hold shares as part of a business conducted through a permanent establishment situated in Switzerland (Non-Resident Holders) are not subject to Swiss income taxes in respect of such distributions. Moreover, gains realized by such recipients upon the disposal of shares are not subject to Swiss income taxes.

Non-Resident Holders of shares are, however, subject to the Withholding Tax on dividends and similar distributions mentioned above and, under certain circumstances, to the Stamp Duty described below. Such Non-Resident Holders may be entitled to a partial refund of the Withholding Tax if the country in which they reside has entered into a bilateral treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with Switzerland. Non-Resident Holders should be aware that the procedures for claiming treaty refunds (and the time frame required for obtaining a refund) may differ from country to country. Non-Resident Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding receipt, ownership, purchase, sale or other dispositions of shares or ADRs, and the procedures for claiming a refund of the Withholding Tax.


### Page 147 ###

As of January 1, 2025, Switzerland has entered into bilateral treaties for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to income taxes with the following countries, whereby a part of the above-mentioned Withholding Tax may be refunded (subject to the limitations set forth in such treaties):

| Ethiopia | Latvia | Serbia |  |

Tax treaty negotiations are underway, or have been conducted, with Angola, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cameroon, Costa Rica, Jordan, Kenya, Libya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Syria and Zimbabwe. Tax treaty negotiations between Switzerland and some of the countries listed in the immediately preceding sentence have been ongoing for an extended period of time, and we are not certain when or if such negotiations will be completed, or when or if the corresponding treaties will come into effect.

A Non-Resident Holder of shares or ADRs will not be liable for any Swiss taxes other than the Withholding Tax described above and, if the transfer occurs through or with a Swiss bank or other Swiss securities dealer, the Stamp Duty described below. If, however, the shares or ADRs of Non-Resident Holders can be attributed to a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business maintained by such person within Switzerland during the relevant tax year, the shares or ADRs may be subject to Swiss income taxes in respect of income and gains realized on the shares or ADRs, and such person may qualify for a full refund of the Withholding Tax based on Swiss tax law.

Residents of the US. A Non-Resident Holder who is a resident of the US for purposes of the Treaty is eligible for a reduced rate of tax on dividends equal to $15 \%$ of the dividend, provided that such holder (i) qualifies for benefits under the Treaty; (ii) is not a company (or, if it is a company, such company directly holds less than 10\% of our voting stock); and (iii) does not conduct business through a permanent establishment or fixed base in Switzerland to which the shares or ADRs are attributable.

Such an eligible holder must apply for a refund of the amount of the Withholding Tax in excess of the 15\% Treaty rate. A Non-Resident Holder who is a resident of the US for purposes of the Treaty is eligible for a reduced rate of tax on dividends equal to 5\% of the dividend, provided that such holder (i) is a company; (ii) qualifies for benefits under the Treaty; (iii) holds directly at least 10\% of our voting stock; and (iv) does not conduct business through a permanent establishment or fixed place of business in Switzerland to which the shares or ADRs are attributable. Such an eligible holder must apply for a refund of the amount of the Withholding Tax in excess of the 5\% Treaty rate. Claims for refunds must be filed on Swiss Tax Form 82 (82C for corporations; 82I for individuals; 82E for other entities), which may be obtained from any Swiss Consulate General in the US or from the Federal Tax Administration of Switzerland at the address below, together with an instruction form. Four copies of the form must be duly completed, signed before a notary public of the US, and sent to the Federal Tax Administration of Switzerland, Eigerstrasse 65, CH-3003 Bern, Switzerland. The form must be accompanied by suitable evidence of deduction of Swiss tax withheld at source, such as certificates of deduction, signed bank vouchers or credit slips. The form may be filed on or after July 1 or January 1 following the date the dividend was payable, but no later than December 31 of the third year following the calendar year in which the dividend became payable. For US resident holders of ADRs, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as depositary, will comply with these Swiss procedures on behalf of the holders, and will remit the net amount to the holders.


### Page 148 ###

Stamp Duty upon transfer of securities. The sale of shares, whether by Swiss residents or Non-Resident Holders, may be subject to federal securities transfer Stamp Duty of $0.15 \%$, calculated on the sale proceeds, if the sale occurs through or with a Swiss bank or other Swiss securities dealer, as defined in the Swiss Federal Stamp Duty Act. The Stamp Duty has to be paid by the securities dealer and may be charged to the parties in a taxable transaction who are not securities dealers. Stamp Duty may also be due if a sale of shares occurs with or through a non-Swiss bank or securities dealer, provided that (i) such bank or dealer is a member of the SIX, and (ii) the sale takes place on the SIX. In addition to this Stamp Duty, the sale of shares by or through a member of the SIX may be subject to a minor stock exchange levy.

## US federal income taxation

The following is a general discussion of the material US federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our shares or ADRs that may be relevant to you if you are a US Holder (as defined below). Because this discussion does not consider any specific circumstances of any particular holder of our shares or ADRs, persons who are subject to US taxation are strongly urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the overall US federal, state and local tax consequences, as well as to the overall Swiss and other foreign tax consequences, of the ownership and disposition of our shares or ADRs. In particular, additional or different rules may apply to US expatriates, banks and other financial institutions; regulated investment companies; traders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting; dealers in securities or currencies; tax-exempt entities; insurance companies; broker-dealers; investors liable for alternative minimum tax; investors that hold shares or ADRs as part of a straddle, hedging or conversion transaction; holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar; partnerships or other pass-through entities; persons who acquired our shares pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation; and persons who hold, directly, indirectly or by attribution, $10 \%$ or more of our outstanding shares. This discussion generally applies only to US Holders who hold the shares or ADRs as a capital asset (generally, for investment purposes), and whose functional currency is the US dollar. Investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning whether they are eligible for benefits under the Treaty.

For purposes of this discussion, a US Holder is a beneficial owner of our shares or ADRs who is (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the US for US federal income tax purposes; (ii) a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the US or a state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust (i) subject to the primary supervision of a US court and the control of one or more US persons, or (ii) that has a valid election in place to be treated as a US person. If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes) holds shares or ADRs,
the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners in a partnership that holds shares or ADRs are urged to consult their own tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences of owning and disposing of such shares or ADRs by the partnership.

For US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder of ADRs generally will be treated as the beneficial owner of our shares represented by the ADRs. However, see the discussion below under "Dividends" regarding certain statements made by the US Treasury concerning depositary arrangements.

This discussion assumes that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.

Dividends. US Holders will be required to include in gross income, as an item of ordinary income, the full amount (without reduction for any Withholding Tax) of the dividend paid with respect to our shares or ADRs at the time that such dividend is received by the US Holder, in the case of shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADRs. For this purpose, a "dividend" will include any distribution paid by us with respect to our shares or ADRs (other than certain pro rata distributions of our capital stock) paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under US federal income tax principles. To the extent the amount of a distribution by us exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such excess will first be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a US Holder's tax basis in the shares or ADRs (with a corresponding reduction in such tax basis), and thereafter will be treated as capital gain, which will be long-term capital gain if the US Holder held our shares or ADRs for more than one year. Under the Code, dividend payments by us on the shares or ADRs are not eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to corporate shareholders.

Dividend income in respect of our shares or ADRs will constitute income from sources outside the US for US foreign tax credit purposes. Subject to the limitations and conditions provided in the Code, US Holders generally may claim as a credit against their US federal income tax liability, any Withholding Tax withheld from a dividend. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. Each US Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor concerning whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax credit will be available with respect to dividends received from us. Alternatively, a US Holder may claim the Withholding Tax as a deduction for the taxable year within which the Withholding Tax is paid or accrued, provided a deduction is claimed for all of the foreign income taxes the US Holder pays or accrues in the particular year. A deduction does not reduce US tax on a dollar-for-dollar basis like a tax credit. The deduction, however, is not subject to the limitations applicable to foreign tax credits, but may be subject to other limitations, and each US Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor.

The US Treasury has expressed concern that parties to whom ADRs are released may be taking actions inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits for US Holders of ADRs. Accordingly, the summary above of the creditability of the Withholding Tax could be affected by future actions that may be taken by the US Treasury.


### Page 149 ###

In general, a US Holder will be required to determine the amount of any dividend paid in Swiss francs, including the amount of any Withholding Tax imposed thereon, by translating the Swiss francs into US dollars at the spot rate on the date the dividend is actually or constructively received by a US Holder, in the case of shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADRs, regardless of whether the Swiss francs are in fact converted into US dollars. If a US Holder converts the Swiss francs so received into US dollars on the date of receipt, the US Holder generally should not recognize foreign currency gain or loss on such conversion. If a US Holder does not convert the Swiss francs so received into US dollars on the date of receipt, the US Holder will have a tax basis in the Swiss francs equal to the US dollar value on such date. Any foreign currency gain or loss that a US Holder recognizes on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the Swiss francs generally will be treated as US source ordinary income or loss.

For a non-corporate US Holder, the US dollar amount of any dividends paid that constitute qualified dividend income generally will be taxable at a maximum rate of $15 \%$ (or $20 \%$ in the case of taxpayers with annual income that exceeds certain thresholds), provided that the US Holder meets certain holding period and other requirements. In addition, the dividends could be subject to a $3.8 \%$ net investment income tax. This tax is applied against the lesser of the US Holder's net investment income or the amount by which modified adjusted gross income exceeds a statutory threshold amount based on filing status. We currently believe that dividends paid with respect to our shares and ADRs will constitute qualified dividend income for US federal income tax purposes, provided that the US Holder meets certain holding period and other requirements. US Holders of shares or ADRs are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability to them of the reduced dividend rate in light of their own particular situation and the computations of their foreign tax credit limitation with respect to any qualified dividends paid to them, as applicable.

Sale or other taxable disposition. Upon a sale or other taxable disposition of shares or ADRs, US Holders generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar value of
the amount realized on the disposition and the US Holder's tax basis (determined in US dollars) in the shares or ADRs. This capital gain or loss generally will be US source gain or loss and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period in the shares or ADRs exceeds one year. In the case of a non-corporate US Holder, any long-term capital gain generally will be subject to US federal income tax at preferential rates, with a maximum rate of $15 \%$ (or $20 \%$ in the case of taxpayers with annual income that exceeds certain thresholds). In addition, the gains could be subject to a $3.8 \%$ investment income tax. This tax is applied against the lesser of the US Holder's net investment income or the amount by which modified adjusted gross income exceeds a statutory threshold amount based on filing status. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations under the Code. Deposits or withdrawals of our shares by US Holders in exchanges for ADRs will not result in the realization of gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes.

US information reporting and backup withholding. Dividend payments with respect to shares or ADRs and proceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares or ADRs received in the United States or through US-related financial intermediaries may be subject to information reporting to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and possible US backup withholding. Certain exempt recipients (such as corporations) are not subject to these information reporting and backup withholding requirements. Backup withholding will not apply to a US Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes any other required certification or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Any US Holders required to establish their exempt status generally must provide a properly executed IRS Form W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification). Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a US Holder's US federal income tax liability, and a US Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.

The depositary's principal executive office is located at 383 Madison Avenue, 11th Floor, New York, New York 10179.

## Fees payable by the depositary to the issuer

Pursuant to a letter agreement effective as of May 11, 2017, as amended from time to time ("the Agreement"), JPMorgan, as our ADS depositary, has agreed to make an annual contribution payment to Novartis at the end of each 12-month period beginning on the effective date of the Agreement and on each subsequent anniversary of the effective date of the Agreement (each such 12-month
period is a "Contract Year"). Beginning in the sixth Contract Year, this annual contribution payment will equal: (a)(1) the applicable fixed contribution amount reflected in the table below, based on the average daily balance during such Contract Year of outstanding ADSs backed by ordinary shares less (a)(2) the custody costs, fees and expenses (including, without limitation, any central securities depository fees, charges and expenses) incurred during the applicable Contract Year (the items in (a)(2) collectively are the "Custody Costs") plus (b) 70\% of the gross issuance and cancellation fees collected by JPMorgan under the Deposit Agreement during such Contract Year minus (c) that portion (if any) of JPMorgan's legal fees, charges and out-of-pocket expenses in excess of USD 50000 for such Contract Year.

| Average Daily Balance Range Start | Average Daily Balance Range End | Fixed contribution |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| At least 30000000 | Up to 66999999 | USD 340000 |
| At least 67000000 | Up to 133999999 | USD 680000 |
| At least 134000000 | Up to 200999999 | USD 1020000 |
| At least 201000000 | Up to 267999999 | USD 1360000 |
| At least 268000000 |  | USD 1700000 |

The fixed contribution amount payable under (a)(1) in respect of a given Contract Year shall be zero if the average daily balance of outstanding ADSs backed by ordinary shares is less than 30000000 during such Contract Year. If the Custody Costs for a Contract Year exceed the fixed contribution amount for such Contract Year, JPMorgan will reduce the contribution payable to us by an amount equal to such deficit.

JPMorgan has further agreed to waive the USD 0.05 per ADS issuance fees that would normally be owed by Novartis in connection with our deposits of shares as part of our employee stock ownership and employee participation plans. Novartis is responsible for reimbursing JPMorgan for all taxes and governmental charges required to have been withheld and/or paid, and not so withheld and/or paid, arising from such waived fees.

## Report of Novartis Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Novartis AG's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

The Board of Directors and management of the Company are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of its published consolidated financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, it used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

KPMG AG, Switzerland, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, which is included in the Form 20-F under "Item 18. Financial Statements-Report of independent registered public accounting firm."

See the report of KPMG, an independent registered public accounting firm, included in the Form 20-F under "Item 18. Financial Statements-Report of independent registered public accounting firm."

There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

# Item 16G. Corporate Governance 

Novartis AG is subject to and compliant with the laws and regulations of Switzerland (in particular, Swiss company and securities laws, SIX Swiss Exchange rules and the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance) and the securities laws of the United States, including NYSE listing standards, as applicable to foreign private issuers of securities. The following summarizes some significant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from those followed by domestic listed US companies under the listing standards of the NYSE:

- Novartis AG shareholders do not receive written reports directly from Board committees.
- External auditors are appointed by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), as opposed to being appointed by the Audit and Compliance Committee.
- While shareholders cannot vote on all equity compensation plans, they are entitled to hold separate, yearly binding votes on Board and Executive Committee compensation.
- The Board has set up a separate Risk Committee that oversees the risk management system and processes, as opposed to delegating this responsibility to the Audit and Compliance Committee.
- The full Board is responsible for overseeing the performance evaluation of the Board and Executive Committee.
- The full Board is responsible for setting objectives relevant to the CEO's compensation and for evaluating his performance.

# Item 16K. Cybersecurity 

## Risk management and strategy

Protecting the security and integrity of the IT systems under our control and safeguarding the privacy of our customers, patients and employees is a top priority for us at all levels. Cybersecurity and data privacy risks are among the core enterprise risks evaluated through our annual enterprise risk management assessment.

The Chief Security Officer oversees our cybersecurity risk management program in partnership with our Chief Information Officer and other business leaders. The program was developed to assess, identify and manage risks from cybersecurity threats and respond to cybersecurity breaches and cyberattacks, and to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and continued availability of information owned by, or in the care of Novartis.

## Governance

To address cybersecurity threats and prevent IT system interruptions, the Information Security \& Compliance (ISC) team, which is headed by our Chief Security Officer, has implemented enterprise-wide policies, processes and practices. Our Chief Security Officer reports to our Chief Information Officer, and is a subject matter expert on information security, privacy, information technology strategy and management with over 20 years of relevant experience across a number of industries, including pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, financial services and consulting. Our Chief Information Officer has 25 years of experience as an IT professional, including 15 years with Novartis, and is responsible for our technology strategy, delivery and operations globally. Our ISC team assesses our systems against our policies and processes, reviews gaps, and prioritizes remediation. Key performance indicators are reported to the Executive Committee of Novartis. The Executive Committee is responsible for oversight of the Company's cybersecurity strategy.

We seek to follow industry best practices, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO 27001 to manage information security. Novartis has risk-based services continuity and systems recovery plans in place for key business processes, which are tested periodically. We also conduct ongoing internal vulnerability analyses (including simulated hacking) as well as external testing via third parties to ensure the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls. We require employees to report IT security incidents to a Cyber Security Operations Center (CSOC) that operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. CSOC is a function within ISC that is responsible for investigating all security incidents and alerts including determining the threat type, incident scope and incident severity. Where appropriate, major incidents are escalated to our Chief Executive Officer, who may then inform our Board of the incident pursuant to our internal procedures. Novartis has not experienced any cybersecurity threats, including as a result of cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect Novartis, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. See "Item 3. Key Information-Item 3.D. Risk factors-Operational risks-Cybersecurity and data protection" for information on risks to Novartis from cybersecurity threats.

As part of its enterprise risk management oversight, the Risk Committee of our Board is responsible for ensuring that the Company has implemented an appropriate and effective risk management system and process, including annually reviewing updates on cybersecurity. The Risk Committee receives updates on cybersecurity risks, which address a wide range of topics, including recent developments, security incidents, evolving standards, vulnerability assessments, thirdparty and independent reviews, the threat environment, technological trends and information security considerations arising with respect to the peers and vendors of Novartis. At least once each year, the Risk Committee discusses the Company's approach to cybersecurity risk management with the Chief Security Officer.

# Notes to the Novartis consolidated financial statements 

## 1. Accounting policies

Novartis is a multinational group of companies (Novartis or Company) specializing in the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of innovative pharmaceutical medicines. The Company is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS') Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. They are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for items that are required to be accounted for at fair value.

The Company's financial year-end is December 31, which is also the annual closing date of the individual entities' financial statements incorporated into the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, either at the balance sheet date or during the year, which affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities, including the distribution liability and the non-cash, non-taxable gain recognized in connection with the distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders, and contingent amounts.

Estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that are considered reasonable under the given circumstances and are regularly monitored. Actual outcomes and results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Revisions to estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised.

At the Novartis AG Extraordinary General Meeting, held on September 15, 2023, our shareholders approved the spin-off of the Sandoz business. Following the shareholder approval, IFRS Accounting Standards required the Sandoz Division and selected portions of corporate activities attributable to Sandoz's business, as well as certain expenses related to the spin-off (the "Sandoz business") to be reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the Sandoz business has been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. This required the year ended December 31, 2023 consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows to present separately continuing operations from discontinued operations, with comparative amounts in 2022 restated on a consistent basis. For further information and disclosures refer to the section "-Distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders" in this Note 1, and in Note 2, and Note 29.

Listed below are the material accounting policies of significance to Novartis or, in cases where IFRS Accounting Standards provide alternatives, the option adopted by Novartis.

## Scope of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include all entities, including structured entities, over which Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland, directly or indirectly has control (generally as a result of owning more than $50 \%$ of the entity's voting interest). Consolidated entities are also referred to as "subsidiaries."

In cases where Novartis does not fully own a subsidiary, it has elected to value any remaining outstanding non-controlling interest at the time of acquiring control of the subsidiary at its proportionate share of the fair value of the net identified assets.

Investments in associated companies (generally defined as investments in entities in which Novartis holds between $20 \%$ and $50 \%$ of voting shares or over which it otherwise has significant influence) and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, except for selected venture fund investments for which the Company has elected to apply the method of fair value through the consolidated income statement.

## Foreign currencies

The consolidated financial statements of Novartis are presented in US dollars (USD). The functional currency of a subsidiary is generally the local currency of that entity. The functional currency used for the reporting of certain Swiss and foreign finance entities is USD instead of their respective local currencies. This reflects the fact that the cash flows and transactions of these entities are primarily denominated in this currency.

For subsidiaries using a functional currency other than USD, the subsidiary's results, financial position and cash flows are translated into USD using the following exchange rates:

- Income, expense and cash flows for each month using the average exchange rate, with the US dollar values for each month being aggregated during the year
- Balance sheet using year-end exchange rates
- Resulting exchange rate differences are recognized in other comprehensive income


## Distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders

At the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of Novartis AG shareholders, held on September 15, 2023, the Novartis AG shareholders approved a special distribution by way of a dividend in kind to effect the spin-off of Sandoz Group AG.

The September 15, 2023, shareholder approval for the spin-off required the Sandoz Division and selected


### Page 178 ###

portions of corporate activities attributable to Sandoz's business, as well as certain expenses related to the spinoff (the "Sandoz business") to be reported as discontinued operations.

The shareholder approval on September 15, 2023, for the spin-off the Sandoz business, required the recognition of a distribution liability at the fair value of the Sandoz business. Novartis policy is to measure the distribution liability at the fair value of the Sandoz business net assets taken as a whole. The distribution liability was recognized through a reduction in retained earnings. It was required to be adjusted at each balance sheet date for changes in its estimated fair value, up to the date of the distribution to shareholders through retained earnings. Any resulting impairment of the business assets to be distributed would have been recognized in the consolidated income statements in "Other expense" of discontinued operations, at the date of initial recognition of the distribution liability or at subsequent dates resulting from changes of the distribution liability valuation.

At the October 4, 2023, distribution settlement date, the resulting gain, which is measured as the excess amount of the distribution liability over the then-carrying value of the net assets of the business distributed, was recognized on the line "Gain on distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders" within the income statement of discontinued operations.

The recognition of the distribution liability required the use of valuation techniques for the purposes of impairment testing of the Sandoz business' assets to be distributed and for the measurement of the fair value of the distribution liability. These valuations required the use of management assumptions and estimates related to the Sandoz business' future cash flows, market multiples, and the opening share price of Sandoz Group AG on the first day of trading its shares on the SIX Swiss Exchange, to estimate day one market value, and control premiums to apply in estimating the Sandoz business fair value. These fair value measurements are classified as "Level 3" in the fair value hierarchy. The section "Goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill" in this Note 1 provides additional information on key assumptions that are highly sensitive in the estimation of fair values using valuation techniques.

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the Distribution (spin-off) of the Sandoz business to Novartis AG shareholders by way of a dividend in kind, and that would otherwise have been avoided, were accounted for as a deduction from equity (within retained earnings). Prior to the recognition of the distribution liability, these costs were recorded as prepaid expenses in the consolidated balance sheet.

For additional disclosures, refer to the section "Distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders" in Note 2 and Note 29.

## Acquisition of assets and businesses

Assets separately acquired are recorded at cost, which includes the purchase price and any directly attributable costs for bringing the asset into the condition to operate as intended. Expected costs for obligations to dismantle and remove property, plant and equipment and restore
the site when it is no longer used are included in their cost.

Acquired businesses are accounted for by applying the acquisition method, unless the optional concentration test is applied. The optional concentration test allows for an election on a transaction-by-transaction basis to account for the acquired business as an asset separately acquired when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.

The acquisition method requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their respective fair values on the date the Company obtains control. The excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration transferred over the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is recognized as goodwill. The valuations are based on information available at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

The application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made, especially concerning the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, inventories, property, plant and equipment and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, and the useful lives of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Estimates of fair value require the use of valuation techniques. These valuations require the use of management assumptions and estimates, including the value of comparable assets in the market, amount and timing of future cash flows, outcomes and costs of research and development activities, probability of obtaining regulatory approval, long-term sales forecasts, actions of competitors, discount rates and terminal growth rates. The section "-Goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill" in this Note 1 provides additional information on key assumptions that are highly sensitive in the estimation of fair values using valuation techniques.

## Goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill

Goodwill arises on applying the acquisition method on the acquisition of a business and is the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred to acquire the business over the underlying fair value of the net identified assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, which are usually represented by the operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the level of this group of CGUs annually, or when facts and circumstances warrant, and any impairment charges are recorded under "Other expense" in the consolidated income statement.

Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are initially recorded at cost. Intangible assets that have been acquired through a business combination are initially recorded at fair value using the acquisition method of accounting.

Intangible assets available for use with a definitive useful life (which includes the categories Currently marketed products and Other intangible assets) are


### Page 179 ###

amortized on a straight-line basis and evaluated for potential impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.

Acquired research and development intangible assets that have not yet obtained marketing approval are recognized as in-process research and development (IPR\&D). IPR\&D is not amortized as it is not yet available for use. It is evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when facts and circumstances warrant. Once a project included in IPR\&D has received marketing approval from a regulatory authority, it is transferred to the "Currently marketed products" category of intangible assets.

An asset, a CGU or a grouping of CGUs is considered impaired when its balance sheet carrying amount exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, which is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Usually, Novartis applies the fair value less costs of disposal method for its impairment assessment. In most cases, no directly observable market inputs are available to measure the fair value less costs of disposal. An estimate is therefore derived indirectly and is based on net present value techniques utilizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates. In the limited cases where the value-in-use method would be applied, net present value techniques would be applied using pre-tax cash flows and discount rates.

Fair value less costs of disposal reflects estimates of assumptions that market participants would be expected to use when pricing the asset or CGU, and for this purpose, management considers the range of economic conditions that are expected to exist over the remaining useful life of the asset. These valuations are classified as "Level 3" in the fair value hierarchy.

The estimates used in calculating the net present values are highly sensitive and depend on assumptions specific to the nature of the Company's activities with regard to:

- Amount and timing of projected future cash flows
- Sales forecasts
- Actions of competitors (launch of competing products, marketing initiatives, etc.)
- Sales erosion rates after the end of a patent, loss of exclusivity or other intellectual property rights protection, and timing of the entry of generic competition
- Outcome of research and development activities (compound efficacy, results of clinical trials, etc.)
- Amount and timing of projected costs to develop IPR\&D into commercially viable products
- Profit margins
- Probability of obtaining regulatory approval
- Future tax rate
- Appropriate terminal growth/decline rate
- Appropriate discount rate

Generally, for intangible assets with a definite useful life, Novartis uses cash flow projections for the whole useful life of these assets. For goodwill, Novartis generally utilizes cash flow projections for a three-year period based on management forecasts, with a terminal value based on cash flow projections usually in line with inflation rates for later periods.

Probability-weighted scenarios are typically used.

Discount rates used consider the Company's estimated weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific asset, country and currency risks associated with cash flow projections, to approximate the discount rate that market participants would use to value the asset.

Due to the above factors, actual cash flows and values could vary significantly from forecasted future cash flows and related values derived using discounting techniques.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Bank overdrafts are presented within current financial debts on the consolidated balance sheet.

## Marketable securities and noncurrent financial assets

Marketable securities are financial assets held for shortterm purposes that are principally traded in liquid markets and are classified within current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The financial impacts related to these financial assets are recorded in "Other financial income and expense" in the consolidated income statement. Non-current financial assets held for long-term strategic purposes are classified within non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The financial impacts related to these financial assets are recorded in "Other income" and "Other expense" in the consolidated income statement.

Marketable securities and non-current financial assets are initially recorded at fair value on their trade date, which is different from the settlement date when the transaction is ultimately effected. Quoted securities are remeasured at each reporting date to fair value based on current market prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active or no market is available, fair values are established using valuation techniques. The majority of non-quoted investments are initially valued at fair value through the purchase price established between a willing buyer and seller. Non-quoted investments are subsequently adjusted based on values derived from discounted cash flow analysis or other pricing models. These investment values are classified as "Level 3" in the fair value hierarchy.

The Company classifies and accounts for its marketable securities and non-current financial assets in the following categories:

- Debt securities are valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with subsequent recycling into the consolidated income statement, as they meet both the "solely payment of principal and interest" and the business model criteria. Unrealized gains and losses, except exchange gains and losses, are recorded as a fair value adjustment in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. They are recognized in the consolidated income statement when the debt instrument is sold, at which time the gain/loss is transferred to "Other financial income and expense." Exchange


### Page 180 ###

gains and losses related to debt instruments are immediately recognized in the consolidated income statement in "Other financial income and expense."

- Fund investments and equity securities of the Novartis Venture Fund are valued at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL). Unrealized gains and losses, including exchange gains and losses, are recognized in the consolidated income statement in "Other income" for gains and "Other expense" for losses.
- Equity securities held as strategic investments, typically held outside of the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at the date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss. Unrealized gains and losses, including exchange gains and losses, are recorded as a fair value adjustment in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. They are reclassified to retained earnings when the equity security is sold. If these equity securities are not designated at the date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income, they are valued at FVPL, as described above.
- Other non-current financial assets, such as loans and long-term receivables from customers, advances and other deposits, are valued at amortized cost, which reflects the time value of money less any allowances for expected credit losses.

The Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt securities valued at fair value through other comprehensive income. Impairments on debt securities are recorded in "Other financial income and expense."

For other financial assets valued at amortized cost, impairments, which are based on their expected credit losses, and exchange rate losses are included in "Other expense" in the consolidated income statement. Exchange rate gains and interest income, using the effective interest rate method, are included in "Other income" or "Other financial income" in the consolidated income statement, depending on the nature of the item.

## Derivative financial instruments

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at fair value and are remeasured to their current fair value at the end of each subsequent reporting period. The valuation of a forward exchange rate contract is based on the discounted cash flow model, using interest rate curves and forward rates at the reporting date as observable inputs.

Options are valued based on a modified BlackScholes model using volatility and exercise prices as major observable inputs.

The Company enters into certain derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging to reduce volatility in the Company's performance due to exposure to
various business-related risks. The risk mitigation is obtained because the derivative's value or cash flows are expected, wholly or partly, to offset changes in the value or cash flows of the recognized assets or liabilities. The overall strategy aims to mitigate the currency and interest rate risk of positions that are contractually agreed, and to partially mitigate the exposure risk of selected anticipated transactions.

Certain derivative financial instruments meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment. A prerequisite for obtaining this accounting-hedge relationship is extensive documentation on inception and proving on a regular basis that the economic hedge is effective for accounting purposes. Other derivative financial instruments do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated in a hedge relationship. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized immediately in "Other financial income and expense" in the consolidated income statement.

In addition, the Company has designated certain long-term debt components as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain net investments in foreign operations. On consolidation, foreign currency differences arising on long-term debt designated as net investment hedges of a foreign operation are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in currency translation effects, to the extent that the hedge is effective. The foreign currency differences arising from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in the income statement in "Other financial income and expense."

When a hedged net investment is disposed of, the proportionate portion of the cumulative amount recognized in equity in relation to the hedged net investment is transferred to the consolidated income statement as an adjustment to the gain or loss on disposal.

## Inventories

Inventory is valued at the lower of acquisition or production cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis and net realizable value. This value is used for the "Cost of goods sold" in the consolidated income statement. Unsaleable inventory is fully written off in the consolidated income statement under "Cost of goods sold."

## Trade receivables

Trade receivables are initially recognized at their invoiced amounts, including any related sales taxes less adjustments for estimated revenue deductions such as rebates, chargebacks and cash discounts.

Provisions for doubtful trade receivables are established using a forward-looking expected credit loss model (ECL). Charges for doubtful trade receivables are recorded as marketing and selling costs recognized in the consolidated income statement within "Selling, general and administration" expenses.


### Page 181 ###

## Legal and environmental liabilities

Novartis and its subsidiaries are subject to contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, environmental remediation liabilities and other product-related and commercial litigation, and governmental investigations and proceedings. A provision is recorded when there is a probable outflow of resources for which a reliable estimate can be made of the outcome of the legal or other disputes against the subsidiary.

## Contingent consideration

In the acquisition or divestment of a business, it is necessary to recognize contingent future amounts due to previous owners, representing contractually defined potential amounts as a liability or an asset. Usually for Novartis, these are linked to milestone or royalty payments related to certain assets and are recognized as a financial liability or financial asset at fair value, which is then remeasured at each subsequent reporting date. These estimations typically depend on factors such as technical milestones or market performance, and are adjusted for the probability of their likelihood of payment, and are appropriately discounted to reflect the impact of time.

Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities in subsequent periods are recognized in the consolidated income statement in "Cost of goods sold" for currently marketed products and in "Research and development" for IPR\&D. Changes in contingent consideration assets are recognized in "Other income" or "Other expense," depending on their nature.

The effect of unwinding the discount over time is recognized for contingent consideration liabilities in "Interest expense" and for contingent consideration assets as interest income recognized in the consolidated income statement within "Other financial income and expense."

## Defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits

The liability in respect of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits is the defined benefit obligation calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The current service cost for defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans is included in the personnel expenses of the various functions in which employees are employed, and the net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset is recognized as "Other expense" or "Other income."

## Revenue recognition

Revenue on the sale of Novartis products and services, which is recorded as net sales to third parties in the line "Net sales from continuing operations" in the consolidated income statement, is recognized when a contractual promise to a customer (performance obligation) has been fulfilled by transferring control over the promised goods and services to the customer, substantially all of which is at the point in time of shipment to, or receipt of, the products by the customer or when the services are performed. If contracts contain customer acceptance provisions, revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of the acceptance criteria. If a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the consideration is allocated based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration Novartis expects to receive in exchange for its goods and services, when it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.

The consideration Novartis receives in exchange for its goods or services may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration is recognized when it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The most common elements of variable consideration are listed below.

- Rebates and discounts granted to wholesalers, retailers, government agencies (including US Medicaid and US Federal Medicare programs), government supported healthcare systems, private health systems, pharmacy benefit managers, managed healthcare organizations, purchasing organizations and other direct and indirect customers, as well as chargebacks are provisioned and recorded as revenue deductions at the time the related revenues are recorded, or when the incentives are offered. The provision represents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the effect of these revenue deductions. These rebates and discounts, applied using provision rates, are estimated based on the terms and conditions in the individual government agencies, states, plans and customer agreements (which may be subject to challenge or change in interpretative guidance by government authorities, payers and customers), historical experience, product sales and growth rate, population growth, product pricing including inflation impacts, the mix of contracts and products, the level of inventory in the distribution channel, regulations, channels and payers, as appropriate to the individual rebate and discount arrangements. These rebate provisions are adjusted based on established processes and experiences, for example from filing data with individual government agencies, states, and plans. There is often a time lag between the recording of revenue deductions and the final accounting for them.
- Refunds granted to healthcare providers under innovative pay-for-performance agreements (i.e. outcome based arrangements) are provisioned and recorded as a revenue deduction at the time the related sales are recorded. The provision represents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the effect of these revenue deductions. They are calculated on the basis of historical experience and clinical data available for the product, as well as the specific terms of the individual


### Page 182 ###

agreements. In cases where historical experience and clinical data are not sufficient for a reliable estimation of the outcome, revenue recognition is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved, until such history is available or the period when the refund right has expired. The provisions for revenue deductions under innovative pay-for-performance agreements are adjusted periodically based on established processes and actual experience, including the products actual outcomes achieved compared with the anticipated predefined targets.

- Cash discounts are offered to customers to encourage prompt payment and are provisioned and recorded as revenue deductions at the time the related sales are recorded.
- Sales returns provisions are recognized and recorded as revenue deductions when there is historical experience of Novartis agreeing to customer returns and Novartis can reasonably estimate expected future returns. The provision represents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the effect of these revenue deductions. In doing so, the estimated rate of return is applied, determined on the basis of historical experience of customer returns and considering any other relevant factors. This is applied to the amounts invoiced, also considering the amount of returned product to be destroyed versus product that can be placed back in inventory for resale. Where shipments are made on a resale or return basis, without sufficient historical experience for estimating sales returns, revenue is only recorded when there is evidence of consumption or when the right of return has expired. The provisions for sales returns are adjusted periodically based on established processes and actual experience.

Net sales to third parties and provisions for revenue deductions are adjusted periodically to reflect experience and to reflect actual amounts as rebates, refunds, discounts and returns are processed. There is often a time lag between recording of revenue deductions and the final accounting for them. The provision represents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the effect of these revenue deductions.
"Other revenue" includes income from profit-sharing arrangements with our collaboration partners, and royalty and milestone income from the out-licensing of intellectual property when Novartis retains an interest in the intellectual property through a license. Royalty income earned from a license is recognized when the underlying sales have occurred. Milestone income is recognized at the point in time when it is highly probable that the relevant milestone event criteria are met, and the risk of reversal of revenue recognition is remote. "Other revenue" also includes revenue from activities such as manufacturing or other services rendered, to the extent such revenue is not recorded under net sales, and is recognized when control transfers to the third party and our performance obligations are satisfied.

## Research and development

Internal research and development (R\&D) costs are fully charged to "Research and development" in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred. The Company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude the capitalization of internal development expenses as an intangible asset until marketing approval from a regulatory authority is obtained in a major market such as the United States, the European Union, Switzerland, China or Japan.

Payments made to third parties such as contract research and development organizations in compensation for subcontracted R\&D, that are deemed not to transfer intellectual property to Novartis are expensed as internal R\&D expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Such payments are only capitalized if they meet the criteria for recognition of an internally generated intangible asset, usually when marketing approval has been received from a regulatory authority in a major market.

Payments made to third parties to in-license or acquire intellectual property rights, compounds and products, including initial upfront and subsequent milestone payments, are capitalized, as are payments for other assets, such as technologies to be used in R\&D activities. If additional payments are made to the originator company to continue performing R\&D activities, an evaluation is made as to the nature of the payments. Such additional payments will be expensed if they are deemed to be compensation for subcontracted R\&D services not resulting in an additional transfer of intellectual property rights to Novartis. Such additional payments will be capitalized if they are deemed to be compensation for the transfer to Novartis of additional intellectual property developed at the risk of the originator company. Subsequent internal R\&D costs in relation to IPR\&D and other assets are expensed, since the technical feasibility of the internal R\&D activity can only be demonstrated by the receipt of marketing approval for a related product from a regulatory authority in a major market.

Costs for post-approval studies performed to support the continued registration of a marketed product are recognized as marketing expenses. Costs for activities that are required by regulatory authorities as a condition for obtaining marketing approval in a major market are capitalized and recognized as currently marketed products.

Inventory produced ahead of regulatory approval is fully provisioned, and the charge is included in "Other expense" in the consolidated income statement, as its ultimate use cannot be assured. If this inventory can subsequently be sold, the provision is released to "Other income" in the consolidated income statement, either on approval by the appropriate regulatory authority or, exceptionally in Europe, on recommendation by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), if approval is virtually certain.

## Share-based compensation

Vested Novartis shares and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) that are granted as compensation are valued at their market value on the grant date and are immediately expensed in the consolidated income statement.

The fair values of unvested restricted shares (RSs), restricted share units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) in Novartis shares and ADRs granted to employees as compensation are recognized as an expense over the related vesting period. The expense recorded in the consolidated income statement is included in the personnel expenses of the various functions in which the employees are employed.

Unvested restricted shares, restricted ADRs and RSUs are only conditional on the provision of services by the plan participant during the vesting period. They are valued at fair value on the grant date. As RSUs do not entitle the holder to dividends, the fair value is based on the Novartis share price at the grant date adjusted for the net present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the holding period. The fair value of these grants, after making adjustments for assumptions related to forfeiture during the vesting period, is expensed on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period.

PSUs are subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria and require plan participants to provide services during the vesting period. The performance criteria are based on Novartis internal performance metrics and, for certain plans, also variables that can be observed in the market, which for Novartis plans is the Novartis total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a specific peer group of companies over the vesting period. The expense is recognized in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and is determined based on a bifurcation into the components based on the performance criteria related to Novartis internal performance metrics and TSR. The number of equity instruments that finally vest is determined at the vesting date. The following paragraphs provide an overview of the accounting policies for the determination of the components of the PSU share-based compensation plan expense.

The portion of the PSUs expense that is subject to performance criteria based on Novartis internal performance metrics over the vesting period is determined based on assumptions concerning the expected performance against the internal performance metrics throughout the vesting period. The assumptions are based on the Company's targets for those performance metrics, and the expected forfeitures due to plan participants not meeting their service conditions. The assumptions are periodically adjusted over the vesting period. For this portion of the PSUs expense, any change in estimates for past services is recorded immediately as an expense or income in the consolidated income statement, and amounts for the remaining vesting period are expensed on a straight-line basis. As a result, at the end of the vesting period, the expense during the entire vesting period represents the amount that will finally vest.

The portion of the PSUs expense that is subject to performance criteria based on Novartis TSR relative to a specific peer group of companies over the vesting
period is determined based on the total fair value of the grant over the vesting period. IFRS Accounting Standards require that these variables that can be observed in the market are taken into account in determining the fair value of the PSUs at the grant date. Novartis determined the fair value of these PSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. For this portion of the PSUs expense, adjustments to expense recognized in the consolidated income statement are only made if a plan participant does not fulfill the service conditions.

Measuring the fair values of PSUs granted that include TSR performance criteria requires the use of estimates. The Monte Carlo simulation used to determine the fair value of the PSUs TSR performance criteria requires the probability of factors related to uncertain future events; the term of the award; the grant price of underlying shares or ADRs; expected volatilities; the expected correlation matrix of the underlying equity instruments with those of the peer group of companies; and the risk-free interest rate as input parameters.

If a plan participant leaves Novartis for reasons other than retirement, disability or death, then unvested restricted shares, restricted ADRs, RSUs and PSUs are forfeited, unless determined otherwise by the provision of the plan rules or by the Compensation Committee of the Novartis Board of Directors, for example, in connection with a reorganization or divestment.

## Income taxes

Income taxes comprise current income taxes and deferred income taxes and are recognized in the same periods as the revenues and expenses to which they relate. Income taxes include interest and penalties incurred during the period, insofar as they are considered an income tax. Income taxes related to items recognized directly to other comprehensive income or to equity are recognized together with the corresponding item, to which the income tax is attributable, directly in other comprehensive income or in equity.

Deferred income taxes are determined using the comprehensive liability method and are calculated on the temporary differences that arise between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying value for financial reporting purposes, except for those temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and associated companies, where the timing of their reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Since the retained earnings of subsidiaries are reinvested, withholding or other taxes on eventual distribution of a subsidiary's retained earnings are only recognized when a dividend is declared or has been planned. Furthermore, deferred income taxes are recognized for the net tax effects of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits.

The Company applies the IFRS Accounting Standards exception to not recognize or disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reduced to the extent that it is not probable that


### Page 184 ###

sufficient taxable profits will be available to enable all or part of the asset to be recovered. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.

The estimated amounts for current and deferred tax assets or liabilities, including amounts related to any uncertain tax positions, are based on applicable tax law and regulations in the various tax jurisdictions, in which the Company operates, which are subject to interpretations based on currently known facts and circumstances.

Tax returns are based on an interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and reflect estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. The tax returns are subject to examination by the competent taxing authorities, which may result in an assessment being made requiring payments of additional tax, interest or penalties.

The calculation of income tax assets and liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. As a result, inherent uncertainties exist in the estimates of the tax positions. Tax liabilities for uncertain tax provisions are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets within current income tax liabilities.

## Impact of new IFRS Accounting Standards, amendments and interpretations in 2024

No new IFRS Accounting Standards were adopted by the Company in 2024, 2023 and 2022. There were no new IFRS Accounting Standards amendments or interpretations that became effective in 2024, 2023 and 2022 that had a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In 2024, the following new IFRS Accounting Standard, which is not yet effective, was issued by the International Accounting Standards Board:

## IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements

IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements was issued by the International Accounting Standards Board in April 2024. IFRS 18 will become effective on January 1, 2027, and is required to be applied retrospectively to comparative periods presented, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, IFRS 18 replaces International Accounting Standards (IAS ${ }^{\circledR}$ ) Standards 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements.

IFRS 18 sets out new requirements focused on improving financial reporting by:

- requiring additional defined structure to the statement of profit or loss (i.e. consolidated statement of income), to reduce diversity in the reporting, by requiring five categories (operating, investing, financing, income taxes and discontinued operations) and defined subtotals and totals (operating income, income before financing, income taxes and net income),
- requiring disclosures in the notes to the financial statements about management-defined performance measures (i.e. non-IFRS measures), and
- adding new principles for aggregation and disaggregation of information in the primary financial statements and notes.

IFRS 18 will not impact the recognition or measurement of items in the financial statements, but it might change what an entity reports as its "operating profit or loss", due to the classification of certain income and expense items between the five categories of the consolidated income statement. It might also change what an entity reports as operating activities, investing activities and financing activities within the statement of cash flows, due to the change in classification of certain cash flow items between these three categories of the cash flows statement. Novartis is currently assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 18.

Based on the Company's assessment, there were no other IFRS Accounting Standards, amendments or interpretations not yet effective in 2024, 2023 or 2022 that would have been expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

# 2. Significant acquisitions of businesses and spin-off of Sandoz business 

The Company applied the acquisition method of accounting for businesses acquired, and did not elect to apply the optional concentration test to account for acquired business as an asset separately acquired.

## Significant acquisitions of businesses in 2024

## Acquisition of Kate Therapeutics Inc.

Goodwill amounted to USD 528 million.

The results of operations since the date of acquisition were not material.

## Acquisition of MorphoSys AG

On February 5, 2024, Novartis entered into an agreement to acquire MorphoSys AG (MorphoSys), a Germa-ny-based, global biopharmaceutical company developing innovative medicines in oncology. The acquisition of MorphoSys adds to our oncology pipeline pelabresib, a late-stage BET inhibitor for myelofibrosis and tulmimetostat, an early-stage investigational dual inhibitor of EZH2 and EZH1 for solid tumors or lymphomasis.

On April 11, 2024, Novartis, through a subsidiary, commenced a voluntary public takeover offer (the "Offer") to acquire all outstanding shares of MorphoSys for EUR 68 per share, representing a total consideration of approximately EUR 2.6 billion in cash on a fully diluted basis. The settlement of the Offer was conditional on a minimum acceptance threshold of $65 \%$ of the MorphoSys outstanding shares.

Novartis purchased during the Offer acceptance period MorphoSys shares on the market for a total amount of EUR 0.3 billion (USD 0.3 billion). The closing conditions of the Offer, including the minimum acceptance threshold of $65 \%$, were fulfilled by the end of the Offer acceptance period, and the acquisition of MorphoSys closed on May 23, 2024, with the settlement payment amounting to EUR 1.7 billion (USD 1.9 billion) to the MorphoSys shareholders for their tendered shares. Subsequent to May 23, 2024, Novartis acquired additional MorphoSys outstanding shares through the German statutory two-week extension period of the Offer (ending on May 30, 2024) for EUR 0.3 billion (USD 0.3 billion). As a result, as at May 30, 2024, Novartis held 89.7\% of the total outstanding share capital of MorphoSys. Total cash paid for the MorphoSys shares purchased by Novartis through to the end of the statutory two-week extension period of the Offer amounted to EUR 2.3 billion (USD 2.5 billion). Non-controlling interests represented $10.3 \%$ of the MorphoSys outstanding shares amounting to USD 0.1 billion and were recognized in equity.

In June 2024, outside the Offer Novartis purchased an additional 1.7\% of MorphoSys shares for EUR 44 million (USD 47 million). As a result, at June 30, 2024, Novartis held approximately $91.4 \%$ of outstanding MorphoSys shares.

On July 4, 2024, Novartis filed a public purchase offer to delist the MorphoSys shares admitted to trading on regulated markets and acquire all MorphoSys AG shares and American Depository Shares (ADS) not held directly by Novartis. In August 2024, the delisting of the MorphoSys shares admitted to trading on regulated markets was completed, and Novartis purchased an additional $3.2 \%$ of MorphoSys shares for EUR 83 million (USD 90 million). As a result, at September 30, 2024, Novartis held approximately $94.5 \%$ of the outstanding MorphoSys shares.

On October 15, 2024, the "squeeze-out" of the remaining minority shareholders of MorphoSys was completed by way of a merger into a wholly-owned Novartis entity. As a result, Novartis held 100\% of the outstanding shares of MorphoSys and non-controlling


### Page 186 ###

interests in equity were reduced to nil. On October 21, 2024, Novartis paid EUR 144 million (USD 156 million) to the former remaining minority shareholders in connection with the "squeeze-out."

The fair value of the total purchase consideration for the $89.7 \%$ stake held on May 30, 2024, was USD 2.5 billion (including cash acquired). The purchase price allocation resulted in net identifiable assets of USD 0.7 billion, consisting primarily of intangible assets other than goodwill of USD 1.1 billion, comprising IPR\&D intangible assets of USD 0.6 billion and other intangible assets (customer out-licensing contracts) of USD 0.5 billion, financial investments and other receivables of USD 0.2 billion, marketable securities of USD 0.4 billion, cash and cash equivalents of USD 0.2 billion, financial debt to third parties of USD 0.9 billion, net deferred tax liabilities of USD 0.1 billion and other net liabilities of USD 0.2 billion. Non-controlling interests amounted to USD 0.1 billion, which were recognized at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of MorphoSys identifiable net assets. Goodwill as at the acquisition date amounted to USD 1.9 billion.

The results of operations since the date of acquisition were not material.

Following the completion of management's analysis of the third-party integrated safety report related to certain clinical trial data readouts, that became available prior to closing of the MorphoSys acquisition, the necessity to perform an interim impairment test of the goodwill attributable to the MorphoSys business acquired at the provisional level of the grouping of CGUs of the MorphoSys business was triggered. This impairment test required the use of valuation techniques to estimate the fair value less cost of disposal of the MorphoSys business. These valuations required the use of management assumptions and estimates related to the MorphoSys business' future cash flows and assumptions on, among others, discount rate ( $8.5 \%$ ) and terminal growth/decline rates ( $-15.0 \%$ ). These fair value measurements are classified as "Level 3" in the fair value hierarchy. The section "-Goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill" in Note 1 provides additional information on key assumptions that are highly sensitive in the estimation of fair values using valuation techniques. The interim impairment test indicated an impairment of the goodwill attributable to the MorphoSys business in the amount of USD 0.9 billion, which was recognized as "Other expense" in the consolidated income statement. As at December 31, 2024, the remaining carrying value of the goodwill attributable to the MorphoSys business amounting to USD 1.0 billion was allocated to the grouping of CGUs at the level of the operating segment of the Company, which is the level where the future synergies will be realized.

## Significant acquisitions of businesses in 2023

## Acquisition of DTx Pharma, Inc.

In the second quarter of 2023, Novartis entered into an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of DTx Pharma, Inc. (DTx), a US based, pre-clinical stage biotechnology company focused on leveraging its proprietary FALCON platform to develop siRNA therapies for
neuroscience indications. DTx's lead program, DTx-1252 targets the root cause of CMT1A-the overexpression of PMP22, a protein that causes the myelin sheath that supports and insulates nerves in the peripheral nervous system to function abnormally. The transaction also includes two additional pre-clinical programs for other neuroscience indications. The transaction closed on July 14, 2023.

The purchase price consisted of a cash payment of USD 0.6 billion and potential additional milestones of up to USD 0.5 billion, which the DTx shareholders are eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified milestones.

The fair value of the total purchase consideration was USD 0.6 billion. The amount consisted of a cash payment of USD 0.6 billion and the fair value of contingent consideration of USD 30 million, which DTx shareholders are eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified milestones. The purchase price allocation resulted in net identifiable assets of USD 0.4 billion, consisting primarily of IPR\&D intangible assets of USD 0.4 billion, cash of USD 0.1 billion and net deferred tax liabilities of USD 0.1 billion. Goodwill amounted to USD 0.2 billion.

The 2023 results of operations since the date of acquisition were not material.

## Acquisition of Chinook Therapeutics, Inc

On June 12, 2023, Novartis entered into an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of Chinook Therapeutics, Inc. (Chinook Therapeutics), a US based clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with two late-stage medicines in development for rare, severe chronic kidney diseases. The acquisition closed on August 11, 2023.

The purchase price consisted of a cash payment of USD 3.2 billion and potential additional payments of up to USD 0.3 billion, which Chinook Therapeutics shareholders are eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified milestones.

The fair value of the total purchase consideration was USD 3.3 billion. The amount consisted of an upfront cash payment of USD 3.2 billion and the fair value of contingent consideration of USD 0.1 billion, which Chinook Therapeutics shareholders are eligible to receive upon achievement of specified milestones. The purchase price allocation resulted in net identifiable assets of USD 2.4 billion, consisting primarily of IPR\&D intangible assets of USD 2.5 billion, net deferred tax liabilities of USD 0.4 billion and other net assets of USD 0.3 billion, including cash of USD 0.1 billion. Goodwill amounted to USD 0.9 billion.

The 2023 results of operations since the date of acquisition were not material.

## Distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders

On July 18, 2023, Novartis announced that its Board of Directors had unanimously endorsed the proposed separation of the Sandoz business to create an independent company by way of a spin-off and to seek shareholder approval for the spin-off of the Sandoz business into a separately traded standalone company, following the complete structural separation of the Sandoz business


### Page 187 ###

into a standalone company (the Sandoz business or Sandoz Group AG) and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and Novartis AG shareholder approval.

At the EGM held on September 15, 2023, Novartis AG shareholders approved a special distribution by way of a dividend in kind to effect the spin-off of Sandoz Group AG, subject to the completion of certain conditions precedent to the distribution. Upon shareholder approval, the Sandoz business was reported as discontinued operations and the distribution liability was recognized at its fair value, which exceeded the carrying value of the Sandoz business net assets.

The conditions precedent to the spin-off were met and on October 3, 2023 the spin-off of the Sandoz business was effected by way of a distribution of a dividend in kind of Sandoz Group AG shares to Novartis AG shareholders and American Depositary Receipt (ADR) holders (the Distribution). Through the Distribution, each Novartis AG shareholder received one Sandoz Group AG share for every five Novartis AG shares and each Novartis ADR holder received one Sandoz ADR for every five Novartis ADR that they held at the close of business on October 3, 2023. As of October 4, 2023, the shares of Sandoz Group AG have been listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX) under the stock symbol "SDZ".

On September 18, 2023, the Sandoz business entered into financing arrangements with a group of banks under which on September 28, 2023, it borrowed a total amount of USD 3.3 billion. These borrowings consisted of a bridge loan in EUR (EUR 2.4 billion) and term loans in EUR (EUR 0.2 billion) and USD (USD 0.5 billion). In addition, the Sandoz business borrowed approximately USD 0.4 billion under a number of local bilateral facilities in different countries. This resulted in a total gross debt of USD 3.7 billion. These outstanding borrowings of the Sandoz business legal entities were recognized in the September 30, 2023 consolidated balance sheet within Liabilities related to discontinued operations and within financing activities cash flows from discontinued operations. Prior to the Distribution on October 3, 2023, Sandoz business legal entities paid approximately USD 3.3 billion in cash to Novartis and its affiliates through a series of intercompany transactions.

At the Distribution date on October 3, 2023, the dividend in kind distribution liability to effect the Distribution (spin-off) of the Sandoz business amounted to USD 14.0 billion, measured by reference to the October 4, 2023 opening Sandoz Group AG share price and applying a control premium. The dividend in kind distribution liability was recorded as a reduction to equity (retained earnings) and remained in excess of the then carrying value of the Sandoz business net assets, which amounted to USD 8.6 billion (see Note 29).

Certain consolidated foundations own Novartis AG dividend-bearing shares that restricts their availability for use by Novartis. These Novartis AG shares are accounted for as treasury shares. Through the Distribution, these foundations received Sandoz Group AG shares representing an approximate $4.31 \%$ equity interest in Sandoz Group AG. Upon the loss of control of Sandoz Group AG through the Distribution on October 3, 2023, the financial investment in Sandoz Group AG
was recognized at its initial fair value based on the opening traded share price of Sandoz Group AG on October 4, 2023 (a Level 1 hierarchy valuation). At initial recognition, on October 4, 2023, the Sandoz Group AG financial investment had a fair value of USD 0.5 billion, and was reported in the fourth quarter of 2023 on the consolidated balance sheet as a financial asset. Management has designated this investment at fair value through other comprehensive income.

The total non-taxable, non-cash gain recognized at the Distribution date of the spin-off of the Sandoz business amounted to USD 5.9 billion, which consists of:

| (USD millions) | Oct 3, <br> 2023 |
| :-- | --: |
| Net assets derecognized ${ }^{1}$ | -8647 |
| Derecognition of distribution liability | 13962 |

## Significant transactions in 2022

## Acquisition of Gyroscope Therapeutics Holdings plc

On December 22, 2021, Novartis entered into an agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of Gyroscope Therapeutics Holdings plc (Gyroscope), a UK-based ocular gene therapy company. Gyroscope focuses on the discovery and development of gene therapy treatments for retinal indications. The purchase price consisted of a cash payment of USD 0.8 billion, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments, and potential additional milestone payments of up to USD 0.7 billion, which Gyroscope shareholders are eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified milestones. The acquisition closed on February 17, 2022.

The fair value of the total purchase consideration was USD 1.0 billion. The amount consisted of an upfront cash payment of USD 0.8 billion (including customary purchase price adjustments) and the fair value of contingent consideration of USD 0.2 billion, which Gyroscope shareholders are eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified milestones. The purchase price allocation resulted in net identifiable assets of USD 0.9 billion, consisting primarily of IPR\&D intangible assets of USD 1.1 billion and net deferred tax liabilities of USD 0.2 billion. Goodwill amounted to USD 0.1 billion.

The 2022 results of operations since the date of acquisition were not material.

## Analysis of tax rate

Novartis has a substantial business presence in many countries and is therefore subject to income taxes in different tax jurisdictions. This leads to differences in income and expense items that are non-taxable or non-deductible (permanent differences) or are taxed at different statutory tax rates in those tax jurisdictions. As a result, there is a difference between our applicable tax rate and effective tax rate.

The applicable tax rate changes from year to year due to changes in the mix of the Company's pre-tax income and changes in statutory tax rates since it is calculated as the weighted average tax rate based on the pre-tax income of each subsidiary.

The main elements contributing to the difference between the Company's overall applicable tax rate and the effective tax rate are shown in the following table:

|  (As a percentage) | 2024 | 2023 | 2022  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

[^0]The effective tax rate of Novartis fluctuates primarily as a result of, among other factors, changes in pre-tax income between countries with varying statutory tax rates and the effects of disallowed expenditures, income not subject to tax, tax credits and allowances, tax rate changes on current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, write-down of investments in subsidiaries, and changes in uncertain tax positions. The table above provides the details of the significant items that impact the comparability of the effective tax rate between years.

In December 2021, the OECD issued model rules for a new global minimum tax framework (Pillar Two). Novartis is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules. A number of governments in countries in which Novartis operates are in the process of enacting or have enacted tax legislation to comply with Pillar Two.

In December 2023, Switzerland partially implemented Pillar Two, whereby effective from January 1, 2024, a 15\% minimum taxation is assessed on Pillar Two qualifying profits earned by companies domiciled in Switzerland (Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax). This Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (QDMTT) does not apply to the Pillar Two qualifying profits earned by a company's affiliates domiciled in tax jurisdictions outside of Switzerland. The QDMTT legislation in Switzerland had no material impact to our current income tax expense in 2024.

On September 4, 2024, Switzerland enacted the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) effective January 1, 2025, which complements the QDMTT. This IIR imposes a 15\% minimum top-up tax on the profits of foreign subsidiaries of Swiss-based multinational companies. Novartis estimates that the IIR will have no material impact to our consolidated financial position, income statement and cash flows.

The Pillar Two tax legislation enacted in 2024 and 2023 in Switzerland and other countries in which we operate had no material impact to the Company's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in 2024 and 2023.

For disclosures on income taxes paid in 2024, 2023 and 2022, see Note 23.2.

| - Discontinued operations |  | 3.00 | 0.41 |
| Total diluted earnings per share (USD) | 5.87 | 7.10 | 3.17 |

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net income attributable to shareholders of Novartis AG by the weighted average number of shares outstanding in a reporting period. This calculation excludes the average number of issued shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.

For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of shares outstanding is adjusted to assume the vesting of dilutive restricted shares (RSs), restricted share units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs), and in 2022
also the conversion of potentially dilutive shares arising from options on Novartis shares under employee compensation plans that have been issued. In January 2023, all outstanding options under these plans expired. As a result, there were no options on Novartis shares issued or outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

No RSs, RSUs or PSUs in 2024, 2023 and 2022, and no options in 2022 were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS, as all were dilutive.

# 10. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities 

The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 12 months or less (short-term leases) and low-value leases. For these short-term and low-value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company allocates the consideration in the lease contract to the lease and non-lease components on the basis of the relative standalone price of each component.

The portion of the lease payments attributable to the repayment of lease liabilities is recognized in cash flows
used in financing activities, and the portion attributable to the payment of interest is included in cash flows from operating activities.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date of the lease over the shorter of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.

Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the balance sheet carrying amount may not be recoverable using cash flow projections for the useful life.

The following table summarizes the movements of the right-of-use assets:

| (USD millions) | 2024 | 2023 |

At December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were no material future cash outflows, including extension options, excluded from the measurement of lease liabilities. The Company's most material lease with a lease term extension, representing a lease liability value of USD 0.7 billion (2023: USD 0.7 billion), has a determined lease term end date of 2071 (2023: 2071). Non-enforceable extension options of up to 10 years have not been included within the measurement of this lease liability, and do not have a material impact to the carrying value of the lease for either 2024 or 2023. Should the landlord agree to a lease extension, rent will be referenced to the market rates as at the commencement of the extension period.

In 2024, the Company completed two (2023: two, 2022: three) sale and leaseback transactions for certain property, plant and equipment as part of the Company's facilities strategy. The transactions resulted in net cash inflows of USD 9 million (2023: USD 273 million, 2022: USD 49 million) and the recognition of USD 14 million of lease liabilities (2023: USD 146 million, 2022: USD 23 million), and USD 2 million of right-of-use assets (2023: USD 109 million, 2022: USD 13 million). The right-of-use assets value reflects the proportion of the property, plant and equipment retained. Extension options have been included where management believe that such options will be exercised. The liabilities reflect the net present value of future lease payments. The net loss on the sale and leaseback transactions amounted to USD 10 million
(2023: net gain USD 18 million, 2022: net gain USD 17 million).

The following table provides additional disclosures related to continuing operations right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for 2024, 2023 and 2022:

${ }^{1}$ Represents the cost of assets and accumulated depreciation/impairments at January 1, 2023, related to the Sandoz business reported as discontinued operations, and the net transfers between discontinued and continuing operations from January 1, 2023 to October 3, 2023. Note 29 provides disclosure of discontinued operations additions, depreciation charge, impairment charge and reversals of impairment change. ${ }^{2}$ Additions to currently marketed products include USD 0.1 billion of capitalized development costs. ${ }^{3}$ Derecognition of assets that are no longer being used or developed and are not considered to have a significant disposal value or other alternative use. Disposals include the divested currently marketed product Alshs.

As at December 31, 2024, the most significant intangible assets within the Currently marketed products category are Leqvio (acquisition of The Medicines Company) and Zolgensma (acquisition of Avexis Inc.). As at December 31, 2024, the carrying value and remaining amortization period for Leqvio is USD 6.3 billion and 11 years, respectively (2023: USD 6.8 billion and 12 years, respectively), and for Zolgensma USD 4.5 billion and 6 years, respectively (2023: USD 5.2 billion and 7 years, respectively).

The estimated useful life of Currently marketed products ranges from 5 to 20 years and amortization charges, impairments and impairment reversals are recognized in the consolidated income statement on the line "Cost of goods sold."

The estimated useful lives of Other intangible assets ranges from 3 to 15 years and amortization charges, impairments and impairment reversals are recognized in the consolidated income statement on the lines "Cost of goods sold," "Selling, general and administration," "Research and development" or "Other expense," or for impairment reversals "Other income," depending on the nature and use of the other intangible asset.

Impairment charges for IPR\&D are recorded in the consolidated income statement line "Research and development."

The Company has no indefinite useful life intangible asset other than goodwill.

The Company's cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated, as at December 31, 2024 and 2023, is at the level of the single global operating segment, which is comprised of a group of smaller cash-generating units. The valuation method of the recoverable amount of the operating segment to which goodwill is allocated is based on the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment charges are recorded under "Other expense" in the consolidated income statement.

The following assumptions were used in the goodwill impairment testing calculation:

|  (As a percentage) |   |
| --- | --- |
|  Terminal growth rate | 1.3  |
|  Discount rate (post-tax) | 7.0  |

The discount rates consider the Company's weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to approximate the weighted average cost of capital of a comparable market participant.

The fair value less costs of disposal for the cash-generating unit containing goodwill, is reviewed for the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. In particular, we considered an increase in the discount rate, a decrease in the terminal growth rate, and certain negative impacts on the forecasted cash flows. These reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not indicate an impairment. "Note 1. Accounting policies-Goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill" provides additional disclosures on how the Company performs goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing.

Trade receivable balances represent amounts due from our customers, which are mainly drug wholesalers, retailers, private health systems, government agencies, managed care providers, pharmacy benefit managers and government-supported healthcare systems. In particular, we monitor the level of trade receivables in countries deemed to have an elevated credit risk. We consider macroeconomic environment, historical experience, country and political risk, in addition to other relevant information when assessing risk. These risk factors are
monitored regularly to determine any adjustments in risk classification. The majority of the past due trade receivables from elevated credit risk countries are due from local governments or from government-funded entities. Deteriorating credit and economic conditions as well as other factors in these elevated credit risk countries have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect these trade receivables, and may require the Company to re-evaluate the expected credit loss amount of these trade receivables in future periods. At December 31, 2024, amounts past due for more than one year are not significant in elevated credit risk countries.

Total trade receivables are denominated in the following major currencies:

${ }^{1}$ Approximately 86.0 million treasury shares (2023: 93.8 million, 2022: 99.0 million) are held in Novartis entities that restrict their availability for use.
${ }^{2}$ Novartis reduced its share capital by canceling shares that were repurchased on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line during previous years.
${ }^{3}$ Shares repurchased on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line under the CHF 10 billion share buyback authority approved at the 2021 Annual General Meeting (AGM), the additional CHF 10 billion authority approved at the 2022 AGM and the additional CHF 10 billion authority approved at the 2023 AGM. Since March 20, 2024, the share repurchases are executed under the authority approved at the 2023 AGM as all earlier authorizations are fully exhausted.
${ }^{4}$ Shares acquired from employees, which were previously granted to them under the respective equity-based compensation plans

${ }^{1}$ Shares repurchased on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line under the CHF 10 billion share buyback authority approved at the 2021 Annual General Meeting (AGM), the additional CHF 10 billion authority approved at the 2022 AGM and the additional CHF 10 billion authority approved at the 2023 AGM. Since March 20, 2024, the share repurchases are executed under the authority approved at the 2023 AGM as all earlier authorizations are fully exhausted.
${ }^{2}$ Shares acquired from employees, which were previously granted to them under the respective equity-based compensation plans
${ }^{3}$ Shares delivered as a result of options being exercised related to equity-based compensation plans and the delivery of treasury shares. The average share price of the shares delivered was significantly below market price, reflecting the strike price of the options exercised.
${ }^{4}$ Equity-settled share-based compensation is expensed in the consolidated income statement in accordance with the vesting period of the equity-based compensation plans. The value for the shares and options granted is credited to consolidated equity over the respective vesting period. In addition, tax benefits arising from tax-deductible amounts exceeding the expense recognized in the income statement are credited to equity.
18.3) Changes in non-controlling interests represent the impact on the non-controlling interest of transactions with minority shareholders, such as change in ownership percentage, dividend payments and other equity transactions.
18.4) Other movements include, for subsidiaries in hyperinflationary economies, the impact of the application of IAS Standards 29 "Financial reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies." See Note 28 for additional disclosures.
18.5) Transaction costs in 2023 of USD 214 million, net of tax of USD 29 million, that were directly attributable to the Distribution (spin-off) of the Sandoz business to Novartis AG shareholders and that would otherwise have been avoided, were recorded as a deduction from equity (retained earnings). See Note 1.
18.6) In 2023, in connection with the Distribution (spinoff) of the Sandoz business, Novartis AG shareholders approved at the EGM held on September 15, 2023, a decrease in Novartis AG share capital in the amount of CHF 22.8 million (USD 17.1 million). The capital decrease resulted in a reduction of the nominal value of the Novartis AG shares by CHF 0.01 from CHF 0.50 per share to CHF 0.49 per share.
18.7) In December 2021, Novartis entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase Novartis shares on the second trading line under its up-to USD 15.0 billion share buyback. The arrangement was updated in July 2022, December 2022, and May 2023, and concluded in June 2023. Novartis was able to cancel this arrangement at any time but could have been subject to a 90-day waiting period. As of December 31, 2022, these waiting period conditions
were not applicable and as a result, there was no requirement to record a liability under this arrangement as of December 31, 2022.

In June 2023, Novartis entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase 11.7 million Novartis shares on the second trading line, which concluded in July 2023.

In July 2023, Novartis entered into a new irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase Novartis shares on the second trading line under its new up-to USD 15.0 billion share buyback. In June 2024, Novartis amended the arrangement to include the repurchase of an additional 8.7 million Novartis shares on the second trading line to mitigate the impact of share deliveries under the equity-based compensation plans for employees. These additional repurchases concluded in October 2024. Novartis was able to cancel this arrangement at any time but could have been subject to a 90-day waiting period. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, these waiting period conditions were not applicable and as a result, there was no requirement to record a liability under this arrangement as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
18.8) At December 31, 2022, the market maker held 3 million written call options, originally issued as part of the share-based compensation for employees, that have not yet been exercised. The weighted average exercise price of these options at December 31, 2022, was USD 66.07 and they had contractual lives of 10 years, with remaining lives less than one year. In the first quarter of 2023, the market maker exercised 3 million written call options and as a result there were no written call options outstanding at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2024.

## Environmental remediation provisions

The following table shows the movements in the environmental liability provisions:

| (USD millions) | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| January 1 | 538 | 588 | 616 |

| December 31 | 498 | 538 | 588 |
| Less current provision | $-12$ | $-20$ | $-53$ |
| Non-current environmental remediation provisions at December 31 | 486 | 518 | 536 |

${ }^{1}$ Represents the environmental remediation provision at January 1, 2023, related to the Sandoz business reported as discontinued operations. Notes 1, 2 and 29 provide disclosures related to discontinued operations.
${ }^{2}$ Cash payments from continuing operations were USD 5 million in 2022.
${ }^{3}$ Releases of provisions credited to the consolidated income statement from continuing operations were USD 18 million in 2022.
${ }^{4}$ Additions to provisions charged to the consolidated income statement from continuing operations were USD 6 million in 2022.

The significant components of the environmental remediation provisions consist of costs to sufficiently clean and refurbish contaminated sites to the extent necessary, and to continue surveillance at sites where the environmental remediation exposure is less significant.

A substantial portion of the environmental remediation provisions relate to the remediation of Basel regional landfills in the adjacent border areas in Switzerland and France. The provisions are reassessed on an annual basis and adjusted as necessary.

In the United States, Novartis has been named under federal legislation (the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in respect of certain sites. Novartis actively participates in, or monitors, the cleanup activities at the sites in which it is a PRP. The provision takes into consideration the number of other PRPs at each site as well as the identity and financial position of such parties in light of the joint and several nature of the liability.

The expected timing of the related cash outflows as of December 31, 2024, is currently projected as follows:

| (USD millions) | Expected <br> cash outflows |
| :-- | :--: |
| Due within two years | 42 |
| Due later than two years, but within five years | 203 |
| Due later than five years, but within 10 years | 184 |
| Due after 10 years | 69 |
| Total environmental remediation provisions | $\mathbf{4 9 8}$ |

## Provisions for product liabilities, governmental investigations and other legal matters

Novartis has established provisions for certain product liabilities, governmental investigations and other legal matters where a potential cash outflow is probable, and Novartis can make a reliable estimate of the amount of the outflow. These provisions represent the Company's current best estimate of the total financial effect for the matters described below and for other less significant matters. Potential cash outflows reflected in a provision might be fully or partially offset by insurance in certain circumstances.

Novartis has not established provisions for potential damage awards for certain additional legal claims against its subsidiaries if Novartis currently believes that a payment is either not probable or cannot be reliably estimated. These not-provisioned-for matters include individual product liability cases and certain other legal matters. Plaintiffs have alleged claims in these matters and the Company does not believe that information about the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the stage of proceedings, the entitlement of parties to appeal a decision and clarity as to theories of liability, damages and governing law. It is therefore, not practicable to provide information about the potential financial impact of these matters. In addition, in some of these matters there are claims for punitive or multiple (treble) damages, civil penalties and disgorgement of profits that in the view of Novartis are either wholly or partially unspecified, or wholly or partially unquantifiable at present. The Company believes that information about these amounts claimed by plaintiffs generally is not meaningful for purposes of determining a reliable estimate of a loss that is probable or more than remote.

A number of other legal matters are in such early stages, or the issues presented are such that the Company has not made any provisions, since it cannot currently estimate either a potential outcome or the amount of any potential losses. For these reasons, among others, the Company generally is unable to make a reliable estimate of possible loss with respect to such cases. It is therefore not practicable to provide information about the potential financial impact of those cases.

There might also be cases for which the Company was able to make a reliable estimate of the possible loss or the range of possible loss, but the Company believes that publication of such information on a case-by-case basis would seriously prejudice the Company's position in ongoing legal proceedings or in any related settlement discussions. Accordingly, in such cases, information has been disclosed with respect to the nature of the contingency, but no disclosure is provided as to an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss.

Note 27 contains additional information on contingent liabilities.

## Summary of significant legal proceedings

The following is a summary of significant legal proceedings to which Novartis or its subsidiaries are currently a party, or were a party and that concluded in 2024.

## Investigations and related litigations Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.) Gilenya marketing practices investigation and litigation

In 2013, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (NPC) received a civil investigative demand from the United States Attorney's Office for the S.D.N.Y. requesting the production of documents and information relating to marketing practices for Gilenya, including the remuneration of healthcare providers in connection therewith. In 2017, the S.D.N.Y. and New York State declined to intervene in claims raised by an individual relator in a qui tam complaint. In 2022, NPC's motion to dismiss this complaint was granted. In December 2024, the appeals court affirmed in part but remanded in part, sending the case back to the district court for further proceedings. The claims are being vigorously contested.

## Lucentis/Avastin' matters

In 2019, the French Competition Authority (FCA) issued a Statement of Objections against Novartis entities, alleging anti-competitive practices on the French market for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatments for wet age-related macular degeneration from 2008 to 2013. In 2020, the FCA issued a decision finding that the Novartis entities had infringed competition law by abusing a dominant position and imposing a fine equivalent to approximately USD 452 million. Novartis paid the fine, again subject to recoupment, and appealed the FCA's decision. In February 2023, the Paris Court of Appeal (Court) overturned the FCA's decision which triggered the reimbursement of the originally paid fine (recorded as "Other income" in the Company's consolidated income statement), and, in March 2023, the FCA appealed the Court's decision.

Novartis is the subject of similar investigations and proceedings involving the competition authority in Greece and is currently in an appeal process in Turkey. Novartis continues to vigorously contest all claims in both countries. Novartis is also challenging policies and regulations allowing off-label/unlicensed use and reimbursement for economic reasons in Turkey.

## Greece investigation

The Greek authorities are investigating legacy allegations of potentially inappropriate economic benefits to healthcare providers (HCPs), government officials and others in Greece. These authorities include the Greek Coordinating Body for Inspection and Control, and the Greek Body of Prosecution of Financial Crime (SDOE), from which the Company received a summons in 2018 and 2020. Novartis has cooperated in these investigations. In 2021, SDOE imposed on Novartis Hellas a fine equivalent to approximately USD 1.2 million; Novartis Hellas appealed the fine and, in September 2023, the Court overturned the decision and fine. The Greek State filed an appeal. In 2022, the Greek State served a civil lawsuit on Novartis Hellas, seeking approximately USD 225
million for moral damages allegedly arising from the conduct that was the subject of the Company's 2020 settlement with the US Department of Justice regarding allegations of inappropriate economic benefits in Greece that was disclosed in the 2020 Annual Report and the 2020 Form 20-F. The claims are being vigorously contested.

## 340B Drug Pricing Program litigation

NPC has brought litigation challenging a number of state statutes purporting to add further obligations on manufacturers under the federal 340B program as to the use of contract pharmacies in those states. NPC has also brought litigation challenging the federal government's refusal to allow NPC to apply a rebate payment model for the 340B program.

In addition, in 2021 and 2023, two medical centers filed Administrative Dispute Resolution proceedings against NPC, seeking the return of alleged overcharges resulting from NPC's contract pharmacy policy. NPC has moved to dismiss these proceedings. Also in 2021, NPC received a civil investigative subpoena from the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Vermont (Vermont AG) requesting the production of documents and information concerning NPC's participation in the 340B Drug Pricing Program in Vermont. NPC responded by providing documents and information to the Vermont AG in 2021 and there have been no further actions since that time.

## Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) litigation

In 2023, following the U.S. government's selection of Entresto for the first round of the IRA's "Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program," NPC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court (USDC) for the District of New Jersey on the grounds that those drug price-setting provisions are unconstitutional under the First, Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. In October 2024, the court granted the government's motion for summary judgment. NPC has appealed to the Third Circuit.

## Product liability litigation

## Tasigna

NPC is a defendant in more than 400 US product liability actions involving Tasigna, alleging that the product caused various cardiovascular effects and that NPC failed to provide adequate warnings about those alleged side effects. State court actions are pending in a multicounty litigation in Bergen County, New Jersey, and federal cases are pending in a multidistrict litigation in the Middle District of Florida. The claims are being vigorously contested.

## Other matters

## Shareholder derivative lawsuit

In 2021, NPC, Sandoz Inc., Novartis Capital Corporation and certain present and former directors and officers of Novartis were named as defendants, and Novartis was named as a nominal defendant, in a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in New York State Court. The plaintiffs, derivatively as purported Novartis shareholders on behalf of Novartis, seek damages and other remedies based on alleged conduct by the corporate and individual defendants. In 2022, the court granted


### Page 217 ###

Novartis motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which the plaintiffs have appealed.

## Concluded legal matters

## 340B Drug Pricing Program litigation

In 2021, NPC received a notification from the US Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) which stated that HRSA believes NPC's contract pharmacy policy violates the 340B statute, and threatened potential enforcement action. NPC subsequently sued HRSA in the USDC for the District of Columbia to challenge HRSA's determination and to enjoin HRSA from taking action with respect to NPC's contract pharmacy policy. HRSA then referred the matter regarding NPC's contract pharmacy policy to the Office of Inspector General of the US Department of Health and Human Services, which could result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties on NPC. The court issued a decision rejecting HRSA's interpretation of the 340B statute, vacating the violation notification and remanding the matter to HRSA. HRSA appealed, and the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit heard argument on the case in 2022. In May 2024, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit issued a decision rejecting HRSA's interpretation of the 340B statute and upholding NPC's contract pharmacy policy. HRSA did not seek review from the US Supreme Court, and the decision is now final.

## Swiss and EU investigation

In September 2022, the Swiss Competition Commission (COMCO) initiated an investigation of the acquisition of certain patents by Novartis from Genentech in April 2020 and their subsequent enforcement against Eli Lilly and other parties, allegedly in an attempt to protect Cosentyx from competing products. COMCO investigated whether enforcement of the patents violated the Swiss Cartel Act. The European Commission also requested information from Novartis regarding this matter. COMCO and the EC have both formally closed their investigations with no findings and both stated that they did not find any indication of anticompetitive conduct.

## Discontinued operations

On October 4, 2023, the separation and spin-off of the Sandoz business was completed (Note 2). Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement that Novartis and Sandoz entered into in connection with that separation and spin-off, Sandoz and Novartis agreed, subject to certain limitations, exclusions and conditions, that Sandoz would retain or assume (as applicable) liabilities, including pending and future claims that relate to the spun-off Sandoz business (whether arising prior to, at or after the date of execution of the Separation and Distribution Agreement). Additionally, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Sandoz agreed to indemnify Novartis and each of its directors, officers, managers, members, agents and employees against liabilities incurred in connection with the spun-off Sandoz business.

# 24. Post-employment benefits for employees 

## Defined benefit plans

In addition to the legally required social security schemes, the Company has numerous independent pension and other post-employment benefit plans. In most cases, these plans are externally funded in entities that are legally separate from the Company. For certain Company entities, however, no independent plan assets exist for the pension and other post-employment benefit obligations of employees. In these cases, the related unfunded liability is included in the balance sheet. The defined benefit obligations (DBOs) of all major pension and other post-employment benefit plans are reappraised annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Plan assets are recognized at fair value.

The major plans are based in Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany (2023: Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan), which represent 96\% (2023: 96\%) of the Company's total DBO for pension plans. Details of the plans in the two most significant countries, Switzerland and the United States, which represent 85\% (2023: 84\%) of the Company's total DBO for post-employment benefit plans, are provided below.

Swiss-based pension plans represent the most significant portion of the Company's total DBO and plan assets. For active insured members the benefits are linked to contributions paid into the plan, interest credits granted and conversion rates applied.

All benefits granted under Swiss-based pension plans are vested, and Swiss legislation prescribes that the employer has to contribute a fixed percentage of an employee's pay to an external pension fund. Additional employer contributions may be required whenever the plan's statutory funding ratio falls below a certain level. The employee also contributes to the plan. The pension plans are run by separate legal entities, each governed by a board of trustees that - for the principal plans - consists of representatives nominated by Novartis and the active insured employees. The boards of trustees are responsible for the plan design and asset investment strategy.

The United States pension plans represent the sec-ond-largest component of the Company's total DBO and plan assets. The principal plans (Qualified Plans) are funded, whereas plans providing additional benefits for executives (Restoration Plans) are unfunded. Employer contributions are required for Qualified Plans whenever the statutory funding ratio falls below a certain level.

Furthermore, in certain countries, employees are covered under other post-employment benefit plans and post-retirement medical plans.

In the US, other post-employment benefit plans consist primarily of post-employment healthcare benefits, which have been closed to new members since 2015. Part of the costs of these plans is reimbursable under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. There is no statutory funding requirement for these plans. The Company is funding these plans to the extent that it is tax efficient.

The following table shows the principal weighted average actuarial assumptions, for the major plans, used for calculating defined benefit plans and other post-employment benefits of employees:

|  | Pension plans |  |  | Other post-employment benefit plans |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |
| Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Discount rate | $1.9 \%$ | $2.2 \%$ | $3.0 \%$ | $5.5 \%$ | $5.5 \%$ | $6.3 \%$ |
| Expected rate of pension increase | $0.3 \%$ | $0.3 \%$ | $0.4 \%$ |  |  |  |
| Expected rate of salary increase | $2.6 \%$ | $3.0 \%$ | $2.9 \%$ |  |  |  |
| Interest on savings account | $2.0 \%$ | $1.3 \%$ | $2.2 \%$ |  |  |  |
| Current average life expectancy for a 65-year-old male in years | 22 | 22 | 22 | 21 | 21 | 21 |
| Current average life expectancy for a 65-year-old female in years | 24 | 24 | 24 | 23 | 23 | 23 |

Changes in the aforementioned actuarial assumptions can result in volatility in the accounting for the Company's pension plans in the consolidated financial statements. This can result in substantial changes in the Company's other comprehensive income, long-term liabilities and prepaid pension assets.

The DBO is significantly impacted by assumptions regarding the rate that is used to discount the actuarially determined post-employment benefit liability. This rate is based on yields of high-quality corporate bonds in the country of the plan. Decreasing corporate bond yields decrease the discount rate, so that the DBO increases and the funded status decreases.

The impact of decreasing interest rates on a plan's assets is more difficult to predict. A significant part of the plan assets is invested in bonds. Bond values usually rise when interest rates decrease and may therefore partially compensate for the decrease in the funded status. Furthermore, pension assets also include significant holdings of equity instruments. Share prices usually tend to rise when interest rates decrease and therefore often counteract the negative impact of the rising defined benefit obligation on the funded status (although the correlation of interest rates with equities is not as strong as with bonds, especially in the short term).

The expected rate for pension increases significantly affects the DBO of most plans in Switzerland, Germany and the United Kingdom. Such pension increases also decrease the funded status, although there is no strong correlation between the value of the plan assets and pension/inflation increases.

Assumptions regarding life expectancy significantly impact the DBO. An increase in longevity increases the DBO. There is no offsetting impact from the plan assets, as no longevity bonds or swaps are held by the pension funds. The Company's actuaries use mortality tables that take into account historic patterns and expected changes, such as further increases in longevity.

The mortality assumptions used for the pension plans in Switzerland were based on BVG 2020 tables with future improvements based on the Continuous Mortality Investigation ('CMI') model. For the pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the US, the Society of Actuaries Pri-2012 mortality tables with generational improvements based on Scale MP-2021 are used.

The following table shows the sensitivity of the defined benefit pension obligation to the principal actuarial assumptions for the major plans in Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany on an aggregated basis (2023 additionally includes Japan):

| (USD millions) | Change in 2024 year-end defined benefit pension obligation | Change in 2023 year-end defined benefit pension obligation |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 25 basis point increase in discount rate | $-484$ | $-528$ |
| 25 basis point decrease in discount rate | 511 | 557 |
| One-year increase in life expectancy | 611 | 644 |
| 25 basis point increase in rate of pension increase | 329 | 366 |
| 25 basis point decrease in rate of pension increase | $-52$ | $-61$ |

The healthcare cost trend rate assumptions used for other post-employment benefits are as follows:

|  | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: |
| Healthcare cost trend rate <br> assumed for next year | $6.5 \%$ | $6.3 \%$ | $6.5 \%$ |
| Rate to which the cost trend <br> rate is assumed to decline | $4.5 \%$ | $4.5 \%$ | $4.5 \%$ |
| Year that the rate reaches <br> the ultimate trend rate | 2033 | 2031 | 2031 |

The following table shows the fair value of plan asset allocation of funded defined benefit pension plans at December 31, 2024 and 2023 on an aggregated basis:

| (USD millions) | 2024 | 2023 |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| Equity securities | 5052 | 4931 |
| Debt securities | 6309 | 6730 |
| Real estate | 3775 | 3821 |
| Alternative investments | 3167 | 3360 |
| Cash and other investments | 565 | 1092 |
| Total | 18868 | 19934 |

Cash and most of the equity and debt securities have a quoted market price in an active market. Real estate and alternative investments, which include hedge fund, private equity, infrastructure and commodity investments, usually have a quoted market price or a regularly updated net asset value.

The strategic allocation of assets of the different pension plans is determined, based upon the local requirements and the market and economic environment, with the objective of achieving an investment return that, together with the contributions paid by the Company and its employees, is sufficient to maintain reasonable control over the various funding risks of the respective pension plans. The asset allocation currently includes investments in shares of Novartis AG as per the below table:

|  | December 31, <br> 2024 | December 31, <br> 2023 |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Investment in shares of Novartis AG |  |  |
| Number of shares (in millions) | 2.3 | 2.3 |
| Market value (in USD billions) | 0.2 | 0.2 |

The weighted average duration of the major plans defined benefit pension obligation is 12.0 years (2023: 12.3 years).

The Company's ordinary contribution to the various pension plans is based on the rules of each plan. Additional contributions are made whenever this is required by statute or law (i.e., usually when statutory funding levels fall below predetermined thresholds). The only significant plan that requires additional funding is in Germany.

The expected future cash flows over the upcoming 10 years in respect of pension and other post-employment benefit plans at December 31, 2024, were as follows:

|  |  | Other post- <br> employment <br> benefit plans |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| (USD millions) | Pension plans |  |
| Company contributions |  | 36 |
| 2025 (estimated) | 353 | 36 |
| Expected future benefit payments |  |  |
| 2025 | 1400 | 36 |
| 2026 | 1316 | 36 |
| 2027 | 1152 | 36 |

| 2030-2034 | 5079 | 160 |

## Defined contribution plans

In many subsidiaries, employees are covered by defined contribution plans. Contributions charged to the consolidated income statement for continuing operations for the defined contribution plans were:

| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Contributions for defined contribution plans continuing operations | 556 | 477 | 483 |

The Company's total personnel costs for continuing operations amounted to USD 12.7 billion in 2024 (2023: USD 12.7 billion; 2022: USD 13.1 billion).

# 25. Equity-based participation plans for employees 

The equity-based compensation expense from continuing operations related to all equity-based participation plans, and the liabilities arising from equity-based payment transactions were as follows:

| (USD millions) | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Expense related to equity-based <br> participation plans | 1307 | 1142 | 982 |
| Liabilities arising from equity-based <br> payment transactions | 262 | 322 | 235 |

Equity-based participation plans can be separated into the following plans:

## Annual Incentive

In 2024, 30\% of the Annual Incentive for the Novartis Company CEO and other Executive Committee members (ECN) was required to be deferred in Novartis shares, after the CEO and Executive Committee members (ECN) have met their mandatory shareholding requirements, and the remainder was paid in cash. If the mandatory shareholding requirements were not met, $50 \%$ was required to be deferred in Novartis shares and the remainder was paid in cash. In 2023 and 2022 the Annual Incentive for the Novartis Company CEO and other Executive Committee members (ECN) was paid 50\% in cash and 50\% in Novartis restricted shares (RSs) or restricted share units (RSUs). In 2024 the Annual Incentive for a select portion of the Novartis management leadership team is paid 100\% in cash. In 2023 and 2022, for a select portion of the Novartis management leadership team, the Annual Incentive was paid 70\% in cash and 30\% in RSs or RSUs.

Both the ECN and a select portion of Novartis management leadership team can opt to invest up to the maximum cash portion of their Annual Incentive to receive further shares. From 2024 only a select portion of the Novartis management leadership team in Switzerland may invest its Annual Incentive in shares through the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP). The cash portion of the Annual Incentive is paid out during March in the year following the end of the performance period, and the shares are granted during January in the year following the end of the performance period.

## Employee share savings plan

Novartis operates employee share savings and purchase plans in certain countries. The most significant is described below.

The ESOP in Switzerland offers participants to choose to receive their Annual Incentive (i) 100\% in shares, (ii) 50\% in shares and 50\% in cash, or (iii) 100\% in cash. After the expiration of a three-year holding period for Novartis shares invested under the ESOP, participants receive one matching share for every two invested shares. Employees eligible for the equity plan "Select" and a select portion of the Novartis
management leadership team are not eligible to receive ESOP matching shares. A select portion of Novartis management leadership team is eligible to invest the Annual Incentive in Novartis shares from 2024 onwards. The Novartis Company CEO and the other Executive Committee members are not eligible to participate in this plan.

## Novartis Employee share purchase plan

In 2022 Novartis started to grant shares under the Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP enables employees to voluntarily purchase Novartis AG shares through payroll deductions at a 15\% discounted price, up to a defined maximum amount. While the ESPP is global in scope, the first phase covered employees in North America (the US, Puerto Rico and Canada). Other countries' employees became eligible to participate in the ESPP commencing in 2024, according to a multi-year phased implementation plan. The shares are not subject to a vesting period.

## Novartis equity plan "Select"

The equity plan "Select" is a global equity incentive plan under which eligible employees may annually be awarded an equity grant. In 2024, the equity grants awarded under the "Select" plan are subject to a three-year staggered vesting period. In 2023 and 2022, equity grants awarded under the Select plan were subject to a three-year cliff vesting period, and for eligible employees of selected Company units a four-year staggered vesting period. Executive Committee members and a select portion of Novartis management leadership team are not eligible to participate in the equity plan "Select."

The equity plan "Select" currently allows participants employed and living in Switzerland to choose the form of their equity compensation in RSs or RSUs. In all other jurisdictions, RSs or RSUs are granted unilaterally.

Until 2013, participants could also choose to receive part or the entire grant in the form of tradable share options. All tradable share options expired on their 10th anniversary from the grant date, which was in January 2023. As a result, at December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding options under the Novartis equity plan "Select."

## Long-Term Performance Plan

The Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP) is a global equity plan for the ECN, a select portion of Novartis management leadership team and up to 2023 employees of Company units with specific targets.

Participants are granted a target number of performance share units (PSUs) at the beginning of every performance period, which are converted into unrestricted Novartis shares after the performance period. The actual payout depends on the achievement of the performance


### Page 229 ###

measures and ranges between $0 \%$ and $200 \%$ of the granted amount. PSUs granted under the LTPP do not carry voting rights, but do carry dividend equivalents that are paid in unrestricted Novartis shares at the end of the performance period.

The LTPP awards are subject to a three-year performance and vesting period. The performance criteria for the ECN are based on both Novartis internal performance metrics and variable that can be observed in the market, which is the ranking of the Novartis total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a global healthcare peer group of 14 other companies, over rolling three-year performance periods. Only ECN members, as from performance cycle 2023, are subject to the TSR performance metric under the LTPP.

TSR for Novartis and the peer companies is calculated as the change in the company share price, which is translated to USD at the relevant exchange rate, including the reinvestment return of dividends, over the threeyear performance period. The calculation is based on Bloomberg standard published TSR data, which is publicly available. The position of Novartis in the peer group determines the payout range based on a payout matrix.

## Other share awards

Selected employees may exceptionally receive Special Share Awards of RSs or RSUs. These Special Share Awards provide an opportunity to reward outstanding achievements or exceptional performance, and aim to retain key contributors. They are based on a formal internal selection process, through which the individual performance of each selected employee is assessed at several management levels. Special Share Awards had a minimum three-year vesting period before 2021 and mainly three years thereafter. In exceptional circumstances, Special Share Awards may be awarded to attract special expertise and new talents to the organization (not applicable to ECN). Externally recruited ECN members are eligible only for special awards that are "buyouts" in the case that it is to replace equity forfeited with their former employer. The equity is provided on a like-for-like basis as the forfeited equity, at a similar value with a similar vesting period, and with or without a performance condition.

Worldwide, employees at different levels in the organization were awarded RSs and RSUs in 2024, 2023 and 2022.

In addition, in 2024, 2023 and 2022, Board members received unrestricted shares as part of their regular compensation.

# Summary of share grants 

The table below provides a summary of share grants (shares, RSs, RSUs and PSUs) for all plans. At the Sandoz Distribution date, all RSU and PSU holders, who were not entitled to the dividend in kind in the form of Sandoz Group AG shares received "keep whole awards" in Novartis AG shares to compensate for the loss of the Sandoz value from their Novartis AG shares. These keep whole awards were accounted for as a modification, which did not significantly change the fair value of the original grant. The change in fair value was measured by comparing the fair value of the grant before the spin-off against the fair value of the grant plus keep whole award right after spin-off.

In 2018, a Company subsidiary provided an uncommitted overnight credit facility to the Novartis Pension Fund, Switzerland, for up to USD 500 million with interest at
the US Federal Funds Rate. This credit facility was not utilized during the current and past years.

## Executive Officers and Non-Executive Directors compensation

As at December 31, 2024, there were 11 Executive Committee members ("Executive Officers"). During 2024, no Executive Officer stepped down.

As at December 31, 2023, there were 11 Executive Officers. During 2023, 1 Executive Officer stepped down.

As at December 31, 2022, there were 11 Executive Officers. During 2022, 5 Executive Officers stepped down.

The total compensation for Executive Committee members and the 13 Non-Executive Directors (14 in 2023 and 15 in 2022) using the Company's accounting policies for equity-based compensation and pension benefits was as follows:

|  | Executive Officers |  |  | Non-Executive Directors |  |  | Total |  |  |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| (USD millions) | $\mathbf{2 0 2 4}$ | 2023 | 2022 | $\mathbf{2 0 2 4}$ | 2023 | 2022 | $\mathbf{2 0 2 4}$ | 2023 | 2022 |
| Cash and other compensation | 19.0 | 18.0 | 25.0 | 4.9 | 4.9 | 4.6 | 23.9 | 22.9 | 29.6 |
| Post-employment benefits | 2.4 | 2.1 | 2.8 |  |  |  | 2.4 | 2.1 | 2.8 |
| Equity-based compensation | 61.9 | 62.2 | 42.6 | 5.4 | 5.0 | 4.8 | 67.3 | 67.2 | 47.4 |
| Total | $\mathbf{8 3 . 3}$ | 82.3 | 70.4 | $\mathbf{1 0 . 3}$ | 9.9 | 9.4 | $\mathbf{9 3 . 6}$ | 92.2 | 79.8 |

During 2024, there was a slight increase in the compensation expense for Executive Officers compared to 2023, mainly as a result of higher cash and other compensation paid for current Executive Officers.

During 2023, there was an increase in the IFRS Accounting Standards compensation expense for Executive Officers compared with 2022, primarily driven by higher equity-based compensation, mainly due to higher realized and expected payouts on the achievement of the defined performance criteria, partly offset by lower
cash and other compensation, due to lower accelerated expenses from stepped down Executive Officers compared with 2022.

The Annual Incentive award, which is fully included in equity-based compensation even when paid out in cash, is granted in January in the year following the reporting period.

The disclosures on Board and executive compensation required by the Swiss Code of Obligations are shown in the Compensation Report of the Company.

## 27. Commitments and contingent liabilities

## Research and development commitments

The Company has entered into long-term research and development agreements with various institutions related
to intangible assets. These agreements provide for potential milestone payments by Novartis, which are dependent on successful clinical development, or meeting specified sales targets, or other conditions that are specified in the agreements.


### Page 231 ###

As of December 31, 2024, the amount and estimated timing of the Company's commitments to make payments under those agreements, which are shown without risk adjustment and on an undiscounted basis, were as follows:

| (USD millions) | 2024 |
| :-- | --: |
| 2025 | 135 |
| 2026 | 402 |
| 2027 | 739 |
| 2028 | 746 |
| 2029 | 653 |
| Thereafter | 8123 |
| Total | 10798 |

## Commitments for capital calls

The Company holds investments in funds in which it has committed to invest further upon future capital calls. As at December 31, 2024, the total uncalled capital commitments for the Company's investments in funds amount to USD 63 million. Note 28 contains further information on the Company's investments in funds.

## Other commitments

The Company has entered into various purchase commitments for services and materials as well as for equipment in the ordinary course of business. These commitments are generally entered into at current market prices and reflect normal business operations. For the disclosure of property, plant and equipment purchase commitments, see Note 9. The Company routinely acquires interests in intellectual property focused on key disease areas and indications that the Company expects to be growth drivers in the future. The Company has a commitment related to a long-term research and development agreement that was entered into in the fourth quarter in 2024 that closed on January 11, 2025 totaling USD 1.9 billion, of which USD 1.0 billion was paid on January 17, 2025.

## Guarantees issued

The Company has issued guarantees to third parties in the ordinary course of business, including for tax, customs or other governmental agencies.

## Contingent liabilities

Novartis companies have to observe the laws, government orders and regulations of the country in which they operate.

A number of Novartis companies are, and will likely continue to be, subject to various legal proceedings and investigations that arise from time to time, including proceedings pertaining to: pricing; bribery and corruption; trade regulation and embargo legislation; product
liability; commercial disputes; employment and wrongful discharge; antitrust and competition; securities; government benefit programs; reimbursement; rebates; healthcare fraud; sales and marketing practices; insider trading; occupational health and safety; environmental regulations; tax; cyber and data security; use of technologies, including AI; data privacy; regulatory interactions; disclosure compliance; and intellectual property. As a result, the Company may become subject to substantial liabilities that may not be covered by insurance and that could affect our business, financial position and reputation. While Novartis does not believe that any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, litigation is inherently unpredictable and large judgments sometimes occur. Consequently, we may in the future incur judgments that could involve large payments, including the potential repayment of amounts allegedly obtained improperly, and other penalties, including treble damages, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flow.

Governments and regulatory authorities around the world have been stepping up their compliance and law enforcement activities in recent years in key areas, including marketing practices, pricing, corruption, trade restrictions, embargo legislation, insider trading, antitrust, cyber security and data privacy. Furthermore, when a government or regulatory authority undertakes an investigation, it is not uncommon for other governments or regulators to undertake investigations regarding the same or similar matters. Responding to such investigations is costly and requires an increasing amount of management's time and attention. In addition, such investigations may affect our reputation, create a risk of potential exclusion from government reimbursement programs in the United States and other countries, and lead to (or arise from) litigation. These factors have contributed to decisions by Novartis and other companies in the healthcare industry, when deemed in their interest, to enter into settlement agreements with governmental authorities around the world prior to any formal decision by the authorities or a court. These government settlements have involved and may in the future involve large cash payments, sometimes in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, including the potential repayment of amounts allegedly obtained improperly and other penalties, including treble damages. In addition, settlements of government healthcare fraud cases and antitrust cases often require companies to enter into corporate integrity agreements (or other similar types of agreements), which are intended to regulate company behavior for a period of years. Our affiliate Novartis Corporation is party to such an agreement, which will expire in 2025. In addition, matters underlying governmental investigations and settlements may be the subject of separate private litigation.

While provisions have been made for probable outflows of economic resources, which management deems to be reasonable or appropriate, there are uncertainties connected with these estimates.

Note 20 contains additional information on these matters.

A number of Novartis companies are involved in legal proceedings concerning intellectual property rights. The


### Page 232 ###

inherent unpredictability of such proceedings means that there can be no assurances as to their ultimate outcome. A negative result in any such proceeding could potentially adversely affect the ability of certain Novartis companies to sell their products, or require the payment of substantial damages or royalties. The timing and the outcome of legal proceedings and their potential financial effect are not predictable.

In the opinion of management, however, the outcome of these actions will not materially affect the Company's financial position but could be material to the results of operations or cash flow in a given period.

The Company's potential environmental remediation liability is assessed based on a risk assessment and investigation of the various sites identified by the Company as at risk for environmental remediation exposure. The Company's future remediation expenses are affected by a number of uncertainties. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the method and extent of remediation, the percentage of material attributable to the Company at the remediation sites relative to that attributable to other parties, and the financial capabilities of the other potentially responsible parties.

Note 20 contains additional information on environmental liabilities.

# Derivative financial instruments 

The following tables show the contract or underlying principal amounts and fair values of derivative financial instruments analyzed by type of contract as at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Contract or underlying principal amounts indicate the gross volume of business outstanding at the consolidated balance sheet date and do not represent amounts at risk. The fair values are determined by reference to market prices or standard pricing models that use observable market inputs as at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

## Derivative financial instruments effective for hedge accounting purposes

At the end of 2024 and 2023, there were no open hedging instruments for anticipated transactions.

## Fair value by hierarchy

As required by the IFRS Accounting Standards, financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. There are three hierarchical levels, based on increasing subjectivity associated with the inputs to derive fair valuation for these assets and liabilities, which are as follows:

The assets carried at Level 1 fair value are equity and debt securities as well as fund investments listed in active markets.

The assets generally included in the Level 2 fair value hierarchy are derivatives, and certain debt securities. The liabilities generally included in this fair value hierarchy consist of derivatives. These are valued using corroborated market data.

Level 3 inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. The assets generally included in Level 3 fair value hierarchy are various investments in funds and unquoted equity security investments. Contingent consideration and other financial liabilities carried at fair value are included in this category.

|  (USD millions) | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  |

Total of fair value gains and losses recognized in the consolidated income statement for assets and liabilities held at December 31, 2023

- Represents the carrying values associated with Level 3 financial instruments at January 1, 2023, related to the Sandoz business reported as discontinued operations. Notes 1, 2 and 29 provide disclosures related to discontinued operations.

During 2024, there were two transfers of equity securities from Level 3 to Level 1 for USD 19 million (2023: USD 63 million), due to the Initial Public Offering of the invested company or lift of certain restrictions.

Realized gains and losses associated with Level 3 long-term financial investments measured at fair value through the consolidated income statement are recorded in the consolidated income statement under "Other income" or "Other expense," respectively. Realized gains and losses associated with Level 3 long-term financial investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are not recycled through the consolidated income statement but are instead reclassified to retained earnings.

During the year, the net gain and net loss recorded on associated companies, fund investments and longterm financial investments at fair value through profit and loss were USD 91 million and USD 136 million, respectively.

To determine the fair value of a contingent consideration, various unobservable inputs are used. A change in these inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The inputs used are, among others, the probability of success, sales forecast, assumptions regarding the discount rate and timing, and different scenarios of triggering events. The inputs are interrelated. The significance and usage of these inputs to each contingent consideration may vary due to differences in the timing and triggering events for payments or in the nature of the asset related to the contingent consideration.

If the most significant parameters for the Level 3 input were to change by $10 \%$ positively or negatively, or where the probability of success (POS) is the most significant input parameter, $10 \%$ were added or deducted from the applied probability of success, for contingent consideration payables and contingent consideration receivables, this would change the amounts recorded in the 2024
consolidated income statement by USD 141 million and USD 135 million, respectively.

## Equity securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income

Equity securities held as strategic investments, typically held outside the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss. Except for the investment in Sandoz Group AG with a fair value of USD 595 million as at December 31, 2023, these are made up of individually non-significant investments. In 2024, the consolidated foundations' investments in Sandoz Group AG shares were fully sold, and the USD 169 million gain on disposal was transferred from other comprehensive income to retained earnings. As at December 31, 2024, the Company holds 52 nonlisted equity securities (December 31, 2023: 61) and 16 listed equity securities (December 31, 2023: 28) in this category with the following fair values:

| (USD millions) | 2024 | 2023 |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| Listed equity securities | 185 | 861 |
| Non-listed equity securities | 321 | 349 |
| Total equity securities | 506 | 1210 |

During 2024 and 2023, dividends received from these equity securities were insignificant. In 2024, equity securities that were no longer considered strategic, with a fair value of USD 95 million (2023: USD 279 million), were sold, and the USD 70 million loss on disposal net of taxes (2023: USD 1 million gain) was transferred from other


### Page 237 ###

comprehensive income to retained earnings. In total, including the disposal of the Sandoz Group AG shares, a USD 81 million gain, net of taxes, was transferred from other comprehensive income to retained earnings (see Note 8).

## Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments

## Market risk

Market risk in general comprises currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk, such as commodity and equity prices. Novartis is exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the market value of investments. The Company actively monitors and seeks to reduce, where it deems it appropriate to do so, fluctuations in these exposures. It is the Company's policy and practice to enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage the volatility of these exposures. It does not enter into any financial transactions containing a risk that cannot be quantified at the time the transaction is concluded. In addition, it does not sell short assets it does not have, or does not know it will have, in the future. The Company only sells existing assets or enters into transactions and future transactions (in the case of anticipatory hedges) that it confidently expects it will have in the future, based on past experience.

## Foreign currency exchange rate risk

The Company uses the US dollar as its reporting currency. As a result, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange movements, primarily in European, Japanese and emerging market currencies. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and other currencies can have a significant effect on both the Company's results of operations, including reported sales and earnings, as well as on the reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows. This, in turn, may significantly affect the comparability of period-to-period results of operations.

Because our expenditures in Swiss francs are significantly higher than our revenues in Swiss francs, volatility in the value of the Swiss franc can have a significant impact on the reported value of our earnings, assets and liabilities, and the timing and extent of such volatility can be difficult to predict.

There is also a risk that certain countries could experience a devaluation of their currency. If this occurs, it could impact the effective prices we would be able to charge for our products and also have an adverse impact on both our consolidated income statement and balance sheet.

Subsidiaries whose functional currencies have experienced a cumulative inflation rate of more than 100\% over the past three years apply the principles of IAS Standards 29 "Financial reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies." The hyperinflationary economies in which Novartis operates are Argentina, Venezuela and Turkey. Venezuela and Argentina were hyperinflationary for all periods presented, and Turkey became hyperinflationary effective May 1, 2022, requiring retroactive implementation of hyperinflation accounting as of January 1,
2022. The impacts of applying IAS Standards 29 are recorded in "Other financial income and expense" and are presented separately in Note 5 - Other financial income and expense.

The Company manages its global currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where management deems appropriate. Novartis may enter into various contracts that reflect the changes in the value of foreign currency exchange rates to preserve the value of assets, commitments and anticipated transactions. Novartis also uses forward contracts and may enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge.

Net investments in subsidiaries in foreign countries are long-term investments. Their fair value changes through movements of foreign currency exchange rates. The Company has designated a certain portion of its long-term euro-denominated straight bonds, maturing in 2028, as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain of these net investments in foreign operations with euro functional currency. As of December 31, 2024, long-term financial debt with a carrying amount of EUR 1.8 billion (USD 1.9 billion; December 31, 2023: USD 2.0 billion), has been designated as a hedge instrument. During 2024, USD 91 million of net of taxes unrealized gains (2023: USD 50 million losses) was recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in currency translation effects in relation with this net investment hedge. The hedge remained effective since inception, and no amount was recognized in the consolidated income statement in 2024 and 2022. In 2023, USD 8 million of accumulated net investment hedge reserve was recognized in the consolidated income statement at the time of the Sandoz spin-off.

## Commodity price risk

The Company has only a very limited exposure to price risk related to anticipated purchases of certain commodities used as raw materials by the Company's businesses. A change in those prices may alter the gross margin of a specific business, but generally by not more than 10\% of the margin and thus below the Company's risk management tolerance levels. Accordingly, the Company does not enter into significant commodity futures, forward or option contracts to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases.

## Interest rate risk

The Company addresses its net exposure to interest rate risk mainly through the ratio of its fixed-rate financial debt to variable-rate financial debt contained in its total financial debt portfolio. To manage this mix, Novartis may enter into interest rate swap agreements, in which it exchanges periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed-upon fixed and variable interest rates.

## Equity risk

The Company may purchase equities as investments of its liquid funds. As a policy, it limits its holdings in an unrelated company to less than 5\% of its liquid funds. Potential investments are thoroughly analyzed. Call options are written on equities that the Company owns, and put options are written on equities that the Company wants to buy and for which cash is available.

## Credit risk

Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this risk, the Company periodically assesses country and customer credit risk, assigns individual credit limits, and takes actions to mitigate credit risk where appropriate (for example payment guarantees, credit insurance and factoring).

The provisions for expected credit losses for customers are based on a forward-looking expected credit loss, which includes possible default events on the trade receivables over the entire holding period of the trade receivables.

In measuring the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics (such as private versus public receivables) and days past due. In determining the expected credit loss rates, the Company considers current and forward-looking macroeconomic factors that may affect the ability of customers to settle the receivables, and historical loss rates for each category of customers.

The Company's largest customer accounted for approximately $17 \%$ of net sales to third parties from continuing operations, and the second largest and third largest customers accounted for $13 \%$ and $7 \%$ of net sales to third parties from continuing operations, respectively (2023: 15\%, 13\% and 8\%, respectively; 2022: 16\%, 12\% and $8 \%$, respectively).

The highest amounts of trade receivables outstanding were for these same three customers and amounted to $19 \%, 12 \%$ and $7 \%$, respectively, of the Company's trade receivables as at December 31, 2024 (2023: 17\%, 13\% and $8 \%$, respectively). There is no other significant concentration of customer credit risk.

## Counterparty risk

Counterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities and money market instruments; credit risk on cash, time deposits and derivatives; as well as settlement risk for different instruments. Issuer risk is reduced by only buying securities that are at least A- rated. Counterparty credit risk and settlement risk are reduced by a policy of entering into transactions with counterparties (banks or financial institutions) that feature a strong credit rating. Exposure to these risks is closely monitored and kept within predetermined parameters. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis, including financial statement and capital adequacy ratio reviews. In addition, reverse repurchasing agreements are contracted, and Novartis has entered into credit support agreements with various banks for derivative transactions. To further reduce the settlement risk, the Company has implemented a multi-currency payment system, Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS), which provides multilateral
netting (payment-versus-payment settlement) of cash flows from foreign exchange transactions.

The Company's cash and cash equivalents are held with major regulated financial institutions, the three largest of which hold approximately $9.6 \%, 7.9 \%$ and $7.7 \%$, respectively (2023: $8.3 \%, 7.5 \%$ and $7.4 \%$, respectively).

The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties and does not have any significant grouping of exposures to financial sector or country risk.

## Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company could not be able to settle or meet its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Novartis Treasury is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management. In addition, liquidity and funding risks, and related processes and policies, are overseen by management. Novartis manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis according to business needs and tax, capital or regulatory considerations, if applicable, through numerous sources of financing in order to maintain flexibility.

Certain countries have legal or economic restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances, but these restrictions do not have an impact on the ability of the Company to meet its cash obligations.

Management monitors the Company's net debt or liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows.

Novartis has a US commercial paper program under which it can issue up to USD 9.0 billion in the aggregate of unsecured commercial paper notes. Under this program, commercial paper notes totaling USD 3.5 billion were outstanding as per December 31, 2024, (2023: USD 3.0 billion) with a weighted average interest rate of $4.5 \%$ (2023: 5.4\%). Novartis also has a Japanese commercial paper program under which it can issue up to JPY 150 billion (approximately USD 1.0 billion) of unsecured commercial paper notes. Under this program, commercial paper notes totaling USD 0.6 billion were outstanding as per December 31, 2024 (2023: USD 0.3 billion) with a weighted average interest rate of $0.5 \%$ (2023: 0.1\%). Novartis further has a committed credit facility of USD 6.0 billion. In May 2024, Novartis replaced its existing USD 6.0 billion credit facility with a syndicate of banks (which was undrawn at its replacement date and December 31, 2023, and had a maturity date of September 2025) with a new USD 6.0 billion credit facility with a syndicate of banks. This credit facility is intended to be used as a backstop for the US commercial paper program. This facility matures in May 2029, and was undrawn as at December 31, 2024.

## Capital risk management

Novartis strives to maintain a strong credit rating. In managing its capital, Novartis focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet. As at December 31, 2024, Moody's Ratings rated the Company Aa3 for long-term maturities and P-1 for short-term maturities, and S\&P Global Ratings rated the Company AA- for long-term maturities and A-1+ for short-term maturities.

## Sensitivity analysis

The Company uses sensitivity analysis disclosures to provide quantitative information about market risks to which it is exposed.

The sensitivity analysis disclosures are in line with the Company's financial risk management policy, and are based on a one-parameter risk model that considers a one-factor linear relationship between risk factors and exposures. They consider aggregated risk exposures arising from the most significant risk factors (currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk) and include


### Page 241 ###

all financial assets and financial liabilities as set forth in the table on page F-61.

The disclosures below illustrate the potential impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a result of hypothetical market movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. The range of variables chosen reflects management's view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period.

## Foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity

The Company uses the US dollar as its reporting currency. As a result, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange movements, primarily in European, Japanese and emerging market currencies, as well as in the Swiss franc. A strengthening (weakening) of the US dollar against these currencies as at December 31, 2024 and 2023 would have affected the measurement of financial instruments denominated in these foreign currencies. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical $5 \%$ increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar would have impacted the Company's consolidated income statement as presented below:

| (USD millions) | 2024 | 2023 |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| 5\% increase in foreign currency exchange rates <br> against USD | -8 | 3 |
| 5\% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates <br> against USD | 9 | -3 |

As of December 31, 2024, the Company designated EUR 1.8 billion (December 31, 2023: EUR 1.8 billion) of its longterm euro-denominated straight bonds as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain net investments in foreign operations with euro functional currency. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical 5\% increase, or decrease, in the foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar, without considering the translation effect of these net investments, would have impacted the Company's consolidated equity as presented below:

| (USD millions) | 2024 | 2023 |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| 5\% increase in foreign currency exchange rates <br> against USD | 91 | 97 |
| 5\% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates <br> against USD | -96 | -102 |

## Interest rate sensitivity

Our portfolio of fixed-income instruments as at December 31, 2024, was mainly composed of time deposits and debt securities.

Novartis uses duration models to approximate the possible change in the value of fixed-income instruments. Based on these models, management believes that a 100-basis point change in interest is deemed a reasonable possible change over a one-year period.

Based on exposures in 2024 and 2023, a hypothetical 100-basis point increase (decrease) in interest rates would not have resulted in a significant increase (decrease) in the fair values of the fixed-income instruments nor in a significant increase (decrease) of cash flows attributable to such instruments.

The vast majority of our outstanding financial debts are straight bonds with fixed interest rates and are therefore not affected by movements in interest rates.

## Equity price sensitivity

Fund investments and equity securities held by the Novartis Venture Fund are valued at fair value through profit and loss. Equity securities held as strategic investments, typically held outside the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss.

The fair value of these fund investments and equity securities was USD 1.1 billion as at December 31, 2024 (December 31, 2023: USD 1.8 billion). The fair values of these investments are impacted by the volatility of the stock market, valuation parameters applied (for nonlisted equities classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy) and changes in general economic factors. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical increase or decrease of $15 \%$ in the risk factors would have impacted the Company's consolidated income statement as presented below:

| (USD millions) | 2024 | 2023 |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| 15\% increase in equity prices | 90 | 91 |
| 15\% decrease in equity prices | -90 | -91 |

A hypothetical increase or decrease of $15 \%$ in the risk factors would have impacted the Company's consolidated equity as presented below:

| (USD millions) | 2024 | 2023 |
| :-- | --: | --: |
| 15\% increase in equity prices | 70 | 182 |
| 15\% decrease in equity prices | -70 | -182 |

# 29. Discontinued operations 

Discontinued operations include the operational results from the Sandoz generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars division and certain corporate activities attributable to the Sandoz business, as well as certain other expenses related to the spin-off. Also included in 2023 is the IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, non-taxable net gain
on the distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders (refer to Notes 1 and 2 for further details).

The Sandoz business operated in the off-patent medicines segment and specialized in the development, manufacturing, and marketing of genericpharmaceuticals and biosimilars. The Sandoz business was organized globally into two franchises: Generics and Biosimilars.

    ${ }^{2}$ The tax rate in 2023 was impacted by non-recurring items such as tax benefits arising from intercompany transactions to effect the spin-off of the Sandoz business, net decreases in uncertain tax positions of the Sandoz business and the favorable settlement of a tax matter related to the Alcon business, which was spun-off in 2019. Excluding these impacts, the tax rate would have been $31.2 \%$ in 2023, compared with $24.1 \%$ in 2022 . The tax rate in 2023 is higher than 2022 primarily due to a change in profit mix between years.

In 2023, the net cash inflows from financing activities from discontinued operations of USD 3.3 billion (2022: USD 119 million) were mainly driven by USD 3.6 billion cash inflows from bank borrowings (including the USD 3.3 billion Sandoz business borrowings from a group of banks on September 28, 2023) in connection with the Distribution (spin-off) of the Sandoz business to Novartis AG shareholders, partly offset by transaction cost payments of USD 0.2 billion (2022: nil) directly attributable to the Distribution (spin-off) of the Sandoz business (see Notes 1 and 2).

For additional information related to the October 3, 2023 Distribution (spin-off) of the Sandoz business to Novartis AG shareholders, effected through a dividend in kind distribution of Sandoz Group AG shares to Novartis AG shareholders and ADR holders, refer to Note 1 and Note 2.

# Statutory Auditor's Report 

To the General Meeting of Novartis AG, Basel

## Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

## Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Novartis AG and its subsidiaries (the Company), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2024, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements (pages F-1 to F-76) give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2024, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and comply with Swiss law.

## Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the "Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements" section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law, together with the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as those of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Key Audit Matters

- Assessment of the recoverable amount for the Leqvio intangible asset
- Provisions for deductions from revenue related to US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate programs

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

## Assessment of the recoverable amount for the Leqvio intangible asset

## Key Audit Matter

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company determined the recoverable amount of the intangible assets other than goodwill based on the fair value less costs of disposal method for which no directly observable market inputs were available. As discussed in Note 11, the Company has intangible assets other than goodwill totaling USD 26915 million as of December 31, 2024, of which USD 6.3 billion related to the currently marketed product Leqvio.

We identified the assessment of the recoverable amount, specifically the sales forecasts, of the Leqvio intangible asset, as a key audit matter. Significant auditor judgment and subjectivity was required to assess the sales forecasts assumptions due to the high degree of subjectivity and estimation uncertainty involved. These sales forecasts assumptions were a significant input in the determination of the recoverable amount of the Leqvio intangible asset.

## Our response

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter:

- We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of a certain internal control related to the Company's intangible asset impairment process for Leqvio, including the development of the sales forecasts;
- We evaluated the reasonableness of management's sales forecasts for Leqvio by (1) comparing the sales forecasts assumptions to company-specific operational information and management's communications to the Board of Directors, (2) comparing the most recent sales performance to previous drug launches, and (3) comparing the sales forecasts assumptions to available external market and industry data; and
- We assessed management's ability to accurately forecast sales by comparing historical sales forecasts for Leqvio to actual results.

For further information on the assessment of the recoverable amount for the Leqvio intangible asset refer to the following:

- Page F-6 (Note 1 Accounting policies);
- Page F-18 (Note 4 Revenues and geographic information); and
- Page F-32 (Note 11 Goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill).

## Provisions for deductions from revenue related to US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate programs

## Key Audit Matter

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records provisions for estimated rebates as a deduction from revenue when the related revenue is recognized. Rebates involve the use of assumptions and judgments in the determination of the provision rates at the time revenues are recorded. Provision rates are influenced by the terms and conditions in the individual agreements, historical experience, product sales and growth rate, population growth, product pricing, the mix of contracts and products, the level of inventory in the distribution channel, regulations, channels and payers. As discussed in Note 22, provisions for deductions from revenue totaled USD 7004 million as of December 31, 2024, a portion of which related to US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate programs (hereafter "US rebates"). We identified the evaluation of the US rebates provisions as a key audit matter. The evaluation of the rebate provision rates required a high degree of subjective auditor judgment as it involved estimating the portion of the Company's consolidated revenue which will ultimately be subject to a related rebate.

## Our response

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter:

- We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's US rebates process related to the development of the rebate provision rates;
- We developed our own independent expectation of the US rebates provisions, by using internal and external information, including historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid, and comparing it to management's actual recorded balances; and
- We assessed management's ability to accurately estimate the US rebates provisions by comparing historically recorded provisions to the actual amount that was ultimately paid by the Company.

For further information on provisions for deductions from revenue related to US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate programs refer to the following:

- Page F-6 (Note 1 Accounting policies);
- Page F-18 (Note 4 Revenue and geographic information);
- Page F-37 (Note 15 Trade receivables); and
- Page F-47 (Note 22 Provisions and other current liabilities).


## Other Information in the Annual Report

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information in the Annual Report. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the standalone financial statements of the company, the compensation report and our auditor's reports thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, which give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.


### Page 250 ###

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law, ISA and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law, ISA and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the Company as a basis for forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors, primarily through the Audit and Compliance Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated to the Board of Directors and the Audit and Compliance Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

In accordance with Art. 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and PS-CH 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.

We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

# Notes to the financial statements of Novartis AG 

## 1. Introduction

The financial statements of Novartis AG, with its registered office in Basel, comply with the requirements of the Swiss accounting legislation of the Swiss Code of Obligations (SCO).

Novartis AG is presenting consolidated financial statements according to IFRS Accounting Standards. Novartis AG has therefore applied the exemption included in article 961d, paragraph 1 SCO, and has not prepared additional disclosures, a separate cash flow statement or a management report for SCO purposes.

## Declaration of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees

Novartis AG does not have employees.

## Significant transactions in 2024

On June 18, 2024, Novartis AG issued five new bonds totaling CHF 2.2 billion (see Note 9).

## Significant transactions in 2023

The Novartis AG shareholders approved the spin-off of the Sandoz business at the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) held on September 15, 2023, subject to the completion of certain conditions precedent to the Distribution.

The conditions precedent to the spin-off were met, and on October 3, 2023, the spin-off of the Sandoz business was effected by way of a distribution of a dividend in kind of Sandoz Group AG shares to Novartis AG shareholders and American Depositary Receipt (ADR) holders ("the Distribution").

Through the Distribution each Novartis AG shareholder received 1 Sandoz Group AG share for every 5 Novartis AG shares and each Novartis ADR holder received 1 Sandoz ADR for every 5 Novartis ADR that they held on October 3, 2023, close of business.

As of October 4, 2023, the shares of Sandoz Group AG have been listed on the Swiss Exchange (SIX) under the stock symbol "SDZ".

At the date of the Distribution, the book value of Sandoz Group AG was CHF 4769 million and consisted of investments in direct and indirect Sandoz subsidiaries (CHF 2781 million) and cash (CHF 1988 million). The Distribution was made at the book value of Sandoz Group AG and was recognized as a reduction to available earnings brought forward (CHF 4769 million).

## 2. Accounting policies

## Financial income and expenses

Current assets and current liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted at year-end exchange rates. Realized exchange gains and losses, and all unrealized exchange losses arising from these as well as those from business transactions, are recorded net as financial income or financial expenses.

## Derivative financial instruments

Derivative financial instruments are used for hedging purposes. These instruments are valued at fair value. When different accounting policies apply for the hedged item and the derivative financial instrument, hedge accounting is applied through measuring the hedged item together with the derivative financial instrument. Derivative financial instruments are included in other current receivables and other current liabilities with direct and indirect subsidiaries.

## Financial assets

Financial assets are valued at acquisition cost less adjustments for foreign currency losses and any other impairment of value.

## Investments

Investments are initially recognized at cost. Investments in Novartis AG direct and indirect subsidiaries are assessed annually and, in case of an impairment, adjusted to their recoverable amount within their category.

## Goodwill

Goodwill is capitalized and amortized over a period of 20 years. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. If necessary, an impairment loss is recognized.

## Bonds

Bonds are valued at nominal value. Any bond premium is accrued over the duration of the bond so that at maturity, the balance sheet amount will equal the amount that is due to be paid.

## Provisions

Provisions are made to cover general business risks of Novartis AG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.

# 3. Other income 

The French Competition Authority (FCA) conducted an investigation into Lucentis against several Novartis subsidiaries. In 2020, Novartis AG was jointly held liable for a fine of EUR 308 million. As Lucentis is commercialized by Novartis subsidiaries, rather than by Novartis AG itself, Novartis AG was fully reimbursed by the operational subsidiary. In 2023, this decision was reformed and the fine of EUR 308 million (CHF 308 million) was reimbursed to Novartis AG. As a result, Novartis AG reimbursed the full amount to the operational subsidiary. These amounts are shown net in the income statement in 2023.

Interest-bearing current receivables and liabilities with Novartis AG direct and indirect subsidiaries contain intragroup arrangements under which Novartis AG grants or receives credits that are available on demand.

Financial assets with Novartis AG direct and indirect subsidiaries include financing arrangements and loans to direct or indirect subsidiaries.

## 8. Investments in direct and indirect subsidiaries

The principal direct and indirect subsidiaries and other holdings of Novartis AG are shown in Note 31 to Novartis AG and its subsidiaries' 2024 consolidated financial statements prepared according to IFRS Accounting Standards.

In 2023, various participations in Novartis AG direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Sandoz-related participations, were distributed by subsidiaries to Novartis AG, which in turn contributed these subsidiaries to Sandoz Group AG. The participation in Sandoz Group AG was distributed as a dividend in kind to Novartis AG shareholders and American Depositary Receipt (ADR) holders on October 3, 2023. As of October 4, 2023, the shares of Sandoz Group AG have been listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX) under the stock symbol "SDZ" (see Note 1).

Novartis AG share capital consisted of registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.49 each.
The total share capital decreased from CHF 1116 million at December 31, 2023, to CHF 1073 million at December 31, 2024, due to a share capital reduction as a result of the cancellation of 88 million repurchased shares with a nominal value of CHF 43 million. The cancellation of the 88 million shares was approved at the Annual General Meeting on March 5, 2024.

During 2023, the total share capital decreased from CHF 1202 million at December 31, 2022, to CHF 1116 million at December 31, 2023, due to a share capital reduction as a result of the cancellation of 126 million repurchased shares with a nominal value of CHF 63 million, and the reduction of the nominal value of Novartis AG shares by CHF 0.01 which amounted to CHF 23 million.

In 2023, in connection with the Distribution (spin-off) of the Sandoz business (see Note 1), Novartis AG shareholders approved a decrease of CHF 23 million in the share capital of Novartis AG at the EGM held on September 15, 2023. The capital decrease resulted in a reduction on September 21, 2023, of the nominal value of the Novartis AG shares of CHF 0.01, from CHF 0.50 per share to CHF 0.49 per share.

Novartis AG has met the legal requirements for legal reserves under articles 659 SCO et. seq. for the treasury shares.

Treasury share purchases during 2024 totaled 79 million (2023: 89 million), with an average purchase price of CHF 94 (2023: CHF 86). No treasury shares were sold during 2024 and 2023. Share-based compensation transactions totaled 10 million shares (2023: 11 million shares).

The number of treasury shares held by Novartis AG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries meet the definitions and requirements of article 659b SCO. As at December 31, 2024, treasury shares held by Novartis AG and its direct and indirect fully-owned subsidiaries totaled 213030 042. It should be noted that within the Novartis AG consolidated financial statements prepared according to IFRS Accounting Standards, some Novartis entities are included in the consolidation scope.

With the effective date of January 1, 2023, article 659b SCO was amended to change the definition of subsidiaries to include foundations of Novartis. This change was implemented as at January 1, 2023, and increased the Novartis AG reported number of treasury shares held by subsidiaries by 96969226 shares in 2023, to reflect the Novartis AG shares held by Novartis foundations.

As of the entry into force of the revised Swiss corporate law on January 1, 2023, Novartis ordinary shares held by Swiss foundations controlled by Novartis no longer carry the right to vote and are therefore included as treasury shares for determining compliance with the legal requirements for legal reserves under SCO articles 659 et. seq. for treasury shares.

Novartis AG is part of the Swiss Novartis value-added tax (VAT) group and is therefore jointly liable for existing and future VAT claims from the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.

In December 2021, Novartis AG entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase Novartis shares on the second trading line under its up-to USD 15.0 billion share buyback. The arrangement was updated in July 2022, December 2022 and May 2023, and concluded in June 2023.

In June 2023, Novartis AG entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase 11.7 million Novartis shares on the second trading line, which concluded in July 2023.

In July 2023, Novartis AG entered into a new irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repurchase Novartis shares on the second trading line under its new up-to USD 15.0 billion share buyback.

In June 2024, Novartis AG amended the arrangement to include the repurchase of additional 8.7 million Novartis shares on the second trading line to mitigate the impact of share deliveries under the equity-based compensation plans for employees. These additional repurchases concluded in October 2024. Novartis AG was able to cancel this arrangement at any time but could have been subject to a 90-day waiting period under certain conditions.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, these waiting period conditions were not applicable and as a result, there was no requirement to record a contingent liability under this arrangement as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

# Statutory Auditor's Report 

To the General Meeting of Novartis AG, Basel

## Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

## Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Novartis AG (the Company), which comprise the balance sheet as at December 31, 2024, and the income statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the financial statements (A-1 to A-10) comply with Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation.

## Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the "Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements" section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.

## Other Information in the Annual Report

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements of the Company, the compensation report and our auditor's reports thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Financial Statements

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.


### Page 262 ###

As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated to the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and PS-CH 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of the financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.

Based on our audit in accordance with Art. 728a para. 1 item 2 CO, we confirm that the proposal of the Board of Directors complies with Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

# Chair's letter

In our first full-year as a pure-play medicines company, Novartis delivered strong results, with double-digit growth in sales and net profit in 2024. The performance validates our strategy and gives us confidence that we are well prepared to grow by focusing on our key therapeutic areas and technology platforms.

The strategic shift from a diversified life sciences company to a focused medicines organization over the last decade has proven to be the right path forward. With the divestment of our non-core activities in animal health, vaccines, and generics, among others, we were able to free up resources and strengthen our position in fast-growing and highly innovative medical fields such as xRNA, radioligand therapy, and gene and cell therapy.

Our recent breakthroughs in breast cancer and kidney and blood diseases demonstrate that our operational focus strengthens our ability to deliver high-value medicines that alleviate society's greatest disease burdens. As we continue to accelerate our research and development efforts and strengthen our commercial capabilities, we expect to continue to grow profitably in the long-term and create sustainable shareholder value.

Our efforts to more efficiently align our Research, Development, and Commercial organizations advanced further. Besides strategic acquisitions to increase our technological capacity and broaden our pipeline, we integrated artificial intelligence more deeply into our day-to-day operations to more efficiently assess new molecules and accelerate drug development timelines.

In view of continuing geopolitical and economic volatility, we are further strengthening our global production and distribution network to withstand potential supply chain disruptions and improve overall resilience. We will stay disciplined in managing our technical and data infrastructure as well as our partner networks and build an agile footprint to quickly adapt to the changing environment.

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters remained high on our agenda. We deepened our commitment to vital topics: improving access to medicines, taking further measures in our fight against climate change, and strengthening our ethics framework, among other things. Our efforts have been recognized by leading independent agencies and are reflected in consistently high rankings.

During my 12-year tenure as Chair, my priorities were, among others, to focus the company on its core pharmaceutical expertise, improve its governance, appoint strong executive leadership, and help create a highly versatile Board of Directors to navigate the increasingly complex healthcare landscape. With Dr. Giovanni Caforio, who after shareholder approval is scheduled to join the Board as Non-Executive Chair in April 2025, Novartis has secured an outstanding leader to guide the company through its next phase.

I thank you for the confidence you have placed in our company and am pleased to be able to propose a dividend increase of 6% to CHF 3.50 at the next Annual General Meeting.

Sincerely,

Joerg Reinhardt
Chair of the Board of Directors

# **CEO's letter**

2024 was a year of impact at Novartis. We reached nearly 300 million patients with our innovative therapies — more than ever before — as we built on the momentum from our successful transformation. We consistently delivered strong financial and operational performance, significant R&D achievements, and sustainable growth, and are well positioned to increase value for shareholders and society moving forward.

Core to our approach is a relentless focus on innovation. It allowed us to develop and expand access to new treatments in our key therapeutic areas and technology platforms.

In oncology, we built on the legacy of our work in areas like breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia with *Kisqali* and *Scemblix*, medicines developed by researchers in Novartis labs — a testament to the strength of our R&D engine. We secured our spot as a global leader in radioligand therapy (RLT), a platform we believe has the potential to transform cancer care. *Pluvicto*, our RLT therapy for advanced prostate cancer, showed strength in the US and Europe. We are exploring new referral pathways and investing in RLT manufacturing to broaden its global availability.

Our investments in cutting edge technology fueled innovation across therapeutic areas. We continue to prioritize platforms like RLT and RNA therapeutics, and increasingly integrate artificial intelligence and data science throughout our R&D activities. These tools are helping uncover potential ways to accelerate drug design and clinical trial processes.

Through a combination of in-house R&D and targeted acquisitions and licensing agreements, we now have more than 30 potential new high-value medicines in our pipeline and expect more than 15 submission-enabling readouts over the next two years.

We remain committed to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. We rank highly among industry peers in a range of key ESG ratings, and were honored to rank number one in the 2024 Access to Medicine Index.

Fostering a culture of innovation depends on people. We aim to recruit, retain, and cultivate the best talent in the world. It's why we've rebuilt our organization to meet tomorrow's global healthcare challenges through a simpler organization, targeted hiring efforts, and investments in new facilities to serve patients around the world.

Our approach delivered solid financial results. This past year saw double-digit growth in net sales and core operating income and improved core margins. Importantly, we delivered strong total shareholder returns for our shareholders over recent years.

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

"We reached nearly 300 million patients with our innovative therapies — more than ever before."

Looking ahead, I'm confident we'll see sales growth average at least 5% annually over the five years to 2029, and reach 40% core operating income margin by 2027!

We're proud of our record and excited about the future. I want to offer a special note of thanks to outgoing Board Chair Joerg Reinhardt, who steps down after decades of leadership at Novartis. His impact will carry forward, and I'm grateful for his years of mentorship.

In recent years, we've narrowed our focus, expanded our reach, and invested in the future. The result is a strong portfolio of innovative therapies that sets us up for sustained growth and finds new ways to improve and extend patients' lives.

Thank you for making that possible. We look forward to continuing our momentum in 2025.

Sincerely,

**Vas Narasimhan**
Chief Executive Officer

# Operating environment

Progress in science and technology raises the possibility of new types of medicines and more efficient drug discovery. At the same time, many people struggle to access healthcare, while aging populations are putting pressure on healthcare systems. On this page, we set out key trends shaping our industry.

## The policy landscape is changing

Evolving legislation and regulations are changing how governments pay for medicines. In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act will impose price controls on select drugs in the Medicare program. The EU is revising the legislative framework for medicines with the aim of improving access and affordability, while China has rolled out a volume-based procurement program to reduce prices for eligible medicines.

## The market for healthcare is evolving

Customer groups have increasing influence on treatment decisions and guidelines, while patients continue to become more informed stakeholders in their healthcare decisions and look for solutions to meet their changing needs.

## Scientific progress is opening new paths to treat disease

Rapid progress in medical science is creating opportunities for new types of treatments. These advances highlight the importance of investment in R&D, including in next-generation technologies such as radioligand therapies and gene and cell therapies.

## Access to medicines remains a challenge

Many people around the world struggle to access healthcare and medicines. The issue is linked to demographic, social, and economic challenges such as aging, poverty, and inequality, as well as to structural issues such as limited healthcare infrastructure, shortages of trained healthcare workers, and the cost of healthcare and medicines. Improving access requires a holistic approach that acknowledges these complex factors and relies on stakeholder collaboration and partnerships.

## Demand for high-quality healthcare continues to rise

Demand for medicines in areas such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and immunology continues to grow in key markets. The US and EU markets are expanding. China is growing rapidly, while spending in Japan is forecast to remain stable.

## AI is poised to reshape the industry

Across the biopharmaceutical industry, we are beginning to realize the benefits of new technologies such as AI in automating processes and generating insights that could help us design new compounds, predict drug safety, or speed up drug discovery. The extent to which companies can harness this potential will depend on their ability to aggregate and analyze large volumes of anonymized health data.

## Healthcare systems are under strain

In many countries, healthcare systems are under pressure. Long-term factors such as aging and lifestyle changes have led to a significant rise in noncommunicable illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease.

## Healthcare systems aim to build climate resilience

Healthcare systems are aiming to build climate resilience, with 45 countries committing to net-zero carbon emissions in their health systems, according to the WHO. At the same time, climate change and nature loss continue to have adverse effects on human health, mainly from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress, with respiratory illnesses also on the rise due to air pollution.

# Strategy 

Novartis is an innovative medicines business engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of a broad range of innovative pharmaceutical medicines.

## Focus areas

We focus on four core therapeutic areas with strong growth potential and high unmet patient needs - cardiovascular, renal and metabolic; immunology; neuroscience; and oncology. This focus enables us to build depth in these therapeutic areas, leveraging our scientific expertise to find new ways to treat and cure disease, intervene earlier in disease pathophysiology, and improve quality of life for patients.

We focus our exploratory research work on these core therapeutic areas but also look beyond them, recognizing that cultivating a robust pipeline and remaining on the leading edge of scientific discovery requires a slightly wider aperture in early research.

We are investing in technology platforms that we expect will deliver future highvalue medicines. We focus on two established platforms (chemistry and biotherapeutics) plus three advanced
platforms (radioligand therapy (RLT), xRNA, and gene and cell therapy) that will play an important role in delivering transformative new medicines.

We focus on priority markets - US, Germany, China and Japan - which together account for most of the expected growth in global healthcare spending over the next five years. Although these are our priority markets, we maintain a strong presence in other markets worldwide.

## Strategic priorities

To support our focus areas, we have three strategic priorities:

## Deliver high-value medicines to accelerate growth

We aim to increase growth, driven by continued strong momentum in our existing portfolio of medicines - including Entresto, Cosentyx, Kisqali, Kesimpta, Scemblix, Pluvicto and Leqvio - and key upcoming launches. Over the longer term, we expect growth will come through delivering high-value medicines that sustain and replace our existing growth drivers.

Our R\&D strategy focuses on an end-toend approach, covering research, development, and commercialization. We concentrate resources on priority programs to maximize early-stage
potential and ensure effective late-stage execution. We also focus on life-cycle management by enhancing the evidence base for key brands.

We increase our chances of discovering new medicines by collaborating with outside researchers and biotech companies. Our network consists of academic and industry alliances working on joint research and drug discovery.

## Embed operational excellence to deliver returns

In an increasingly competitive environment, we are simplifying processes and reducing costs to become more efficient and effective in our decisionmaking and to free up resources for investment in new medicines. Our goal is to continue making attractive returns to shareholders while creating value for patients, healthcare systems and society.

## Our focus areas

## Core therapeutic areas:

Cardiovascular, renal and metabolic; immunology; neuroscience; oncology

## Technology platforms:

Chemistry; biotherapeutics; radioligand therapy; xRNA therapy; gene and cell therapy

## Priority markets:

US; Germany; China; Japan

## Our priorities

## Accelerate growth

Deliver high-value medicines

## Deliver returns

Embed operational excellence

## Strengthen foundations

- Utilize the power of our people
- Scale data science and technology
- Build trust with society


### Page 14 ###

In our manufacturing sites, we are expanding capacity in strategic focus areas such as biopharmaceuticals and advanced technology platforms. For example, we are investing to expand our platform for RLT, a type of precision nuclear medicine that requires quick delivery to patients, since the activity of the radioisotope it contains diminishes over time.

To ensure product quality, we maintain a quality management system for our medicines in compliance with requirements from health authorities and other regulators. We are also switching more of our production to renewable energy and reducing the environmental footprint of our sites.

## Strengthen our foundations

# Business model

## Research and development

The discovery and development of a new drug usually requires approximately 10 to 15 years from initial research to launch.

Our research and early development program is conducted by our Biomedical Research unit, which is responsible for the discovery of new medicines that bring value for patients, healthcare systems and the company. We have 5582 full-timeequivalent scientists, physicians and business professionals at Biomedical Research sites.

Our Development unit oversees and executes drug development activities, working collaboratively with Biomedical Research, our commercial units and other parts of the company on our overall pipeline strategy. It has 12773 full-timeequivalent employees worldwide. Our development process consists of two stages: early development to build confidence in the overall properties of the compound, followed by confirmatory development to confirm the concept in large numbers of patients.

We continue to make significant investments to support our R\&D strategy. In 2024, our core R\&D expense from continuing operations was USD 9.3 billion, compared with USD 8.6 billion in the prior year.

## Production

Novartis operates 33 manufacturing sites worldwide. Our primary goal is to ensure the uninterrupted and timely supply of medicines that meet all product specifications and quality standards, and that are produced in the most costeffective and sustainable manner. The manufacturing of our products is highly regulated by governmental health authorities around the world. In addition to regulatory requirements, many of our products involve technically complex manufacturing processes or require highly specialized raw materials.

## Regulatory submission

To register a pharmaceutical product, a registration dossier containing evidence establishing the safety, efficacy and quality of the product must be submitted to regulatory authorities. If approved, we generally have certain exclusive rights to market and sell the medicine for a defined period.

## Marketing and sales

Novartis sells products in approximately 120 countries worldwide. Although specific distribution patterns vary by country, Novartis sells its prescription drugs primarily to drug wholesalers, retailers, private health systems, government agencies, managed care providers, pharmacy benefit managers and government-supported healthcare systems. We reach healthcare professionals and patients in many markets and across our core therapeutic areas through integrated channels including field-force operations, patient support programs and Novartis-owned digital platforms. Novartis also pursues co-promotion or co-marketing opportunities as well as licensing and distribution agreements with other companies in various markets.

We have 19135 full-time-equivalent field-force employees, as of December 31, 2024, including supervisors and administrative personnel. These trained representatives present the therapeutic benefits and risks of our products to physicians, pharmacists, hospitals, insurance groups, managed care organizations and other healthcare professionals.

## Upstream: supply chain

Novartis works with thousands of business partners. To reduce supply risk, we maintain multiple sources for key inputs and raw materials. We require our partners to comply with applicable laws and regulations, as well as Novartis standards, including those for quality, ethics, environmental sustainability and human rights.

## Downstream: healthcare systems and patients

Our medicines are prescribed for use in patients by physicians or other healthcare professionals. In 2024, Novartis medicines reached 296 million patients worldwide.

# Material topics

We continually review trends and changes in our operating environment and business model to identify and assess the relevance of our most material topics — those where we have the most impact on people and the environment and that could have the most significant potential impact on our business.

Results from this assessment inform both our strategy and our approach to reporting. The assessment complements our annual risk analysis (see page 53).

Our most recent materiality assessment, conducted in 2021, reflects the input of more than 500 external and 12 000 internal stakeholders. Respondents were asked to estimate the impact of Novartis on eight separate topic areas. The chart opposite shows the results.

External stakeholders were drawn from our main stakeholder groups, including patients, customers, partners, and shareholders. Internal stakeholders were drawn from senior management, as well as units and functions.

## Financial performance

### Company overview^{1}

Novartis delivered a strong performance in 2024. Full-year net sales were USD 50.3 billion, an increase of 11% in USD reported terms and up 12% measured in constant currencies (cc)^{2} to remove the impact of exchange rate movements.

Novartis sales in the US grew by 18%. Sales in Europe grew by 5% (cc). Sales in emerging growth markets grew 15% (cc), including a 21% (cc) increase in China.

Operating income was USD 14.5 billion, up 55% (cc) from the prior year, mainly driven by higher net sales, lower impairments, amortization and restructuring charges, partly offset by prior-year one-time income from legal matters and higher R&D investments.

Net income was USD 11.9 billion, increasing by 45% (cc) from the prior year mainly driven by higher operating income, partly offset by higher income taxes from continuing operations, mainly resulting from higher income before taxes in the current year and non-recurring tax benefits in the prior year. Earnings per share were USD 5.92, up 49% (cc).

To help stakeholders better understand our underlying performance, we also present our core results, which exclude the impact of amortization, restructurings, acquisitions and other significant items.

Core operating income of USD 19.5 billion rose 22% (cc). Core operating income margin was 38.7% of net sales, increasing by 3.3 percentage points (cc). Core net income of USD 15.8 billion rose 21% (cc). Core earnings per share were USD 7.81, up 24% (cc). Free cash flow of USD 16.3 billion was up 24%.

For detailed information on our financial performance see the Annual Report 2024.

### Cardiovascular, renal and metabolic

*Entresto* (USD 7.8 billion, +31% cc) penetration grew in the US and Europe through continued adoption of guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure. In China and Japan, volume growth was fueled by heart failure and hypertension.

*Leqvio* (USD 0.8 billion, +114% cc) launch in the US and other markets is ongoing, with a focus on increasing account and patient adoption, and continuing medical education.

## Innovation performance

## Cardiovascular, renal and metabolic

In our renal portfolio, we are making progress in advancing new therapeutic options for rare kidney diseases, which may preserve kidney function and help people live longer without the need for dialysis or transplantation.

We received accelerated US approval for Fabhalta (iptacopan) to treat adults with
immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), a disease in which the immune system attacks the kidneys, often causing inflammation and proteinuria (high levels of protein in urine). The approval was based on the interim analysis of a Phase III study that showed a reduction in proteinuria compared with placebo.

Fabhalta is the first of our renal pipeline to receive FDA approval. In 2024, we also submitted atrasentan, which has a different mechanism of action to Fabhalta, for approval in the US based on the interim results of a Phase III study that showed a reduction in proteinuria compared with placebo for patients with IgAN.

We also filed regulatory submissions in the EU, China, Japan and the US for Fabhalta to treat adult patients with C3 glomerulopathy, another rare kidney disease that initially presents in mostly children and young adults and currently has no approved treatment options. The submissions followed positive results from a Phase III trial in adult patients. Enrollment is ongoing in a separate cohort of adolescent patients with C3G.

Fabhalta, which was discovered and developed by Novartis, has the potential to treat multiple diseases, within the renal space and across broader therapeutic areas. In 2024, we also received regulatory approval for Fabhalta in the EU and Japan to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare and serious blood disorder, building on the US approval for PNH in the previous year.

In our cardiovascular portfolio, we announced positive topline results from a Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy of Leqvio (inclisiran) as monotherapy in patients at low or moderate risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who are not receiving lipid-lowering therapy. The trial adds to the growing body of evidence for Leqvio across the full spectrum of ASCVD as we strive to help more patients in need. Leqvio is registered in more than 105 countries and commercially available in 78.

## Immunology

We announced data from two pivotal Phase III studies of remibrutinib to treat patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), which showed significant improvements in patients who remained symptomatic despite H1-antihistamine use. CSU, also known as chronic hives, is an immunological disease, characterized by the sudden appearance of itchy hives and/or deep tissue swelling, that can severely impact quality of life.

We plan to submit remibrutinib for regulatory approval in the US and Europe in 2025. If approved, it has the potential to become the first of a new class of CSU treatment in a decade, offering an effective treatment option for the $60 \%$ of patients uncontrolled by H1-antihistamines.

## Neuroscience

We announced data that continue to support the clinical benefit of OAV101 IT (onasemnogene abeparvovec) to treat
spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare, genetic neuromuscular disease and a leading genetic cause of infant death. The primary objective of the Phase III study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OAV101 IT in patients with SMA aged 2-18. Many patients with SMA currently rely on chronic treatments to manage their disease. These positive topline results from the STEER trial underscore the efficacy, safety and tolerability of OAV101 IT in patients with SMA aged two and above.

## Oncology

We received approval in the US and Europe for Kisqali (ribociclib) for use with an aromatase inhibitor to treat people with HR+/HER2- stage II and III early breast cancer who are at high risk of recurrence. This decision was based on the Phase III NATALEE trial, which showed that Kisqali reduces the risk of the cancer coming back by $25 \%$ compared with hormone therapy alone. This approval means that more patients, including those without lymph node involvement, can now benefit from this treatment.

In addition, we received accelerated approval in the US for Scemblix (asciminib) to treat adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP). The expanded indication in Ph+ CML-CP, which now includes newly diagnosed and previously treated adults, increases the population eligible for Scemblix by


### Page 21 ###

approximately four times. Scemblix is under regulatory review in this indication in key international markets worldwide, including in China and Japan.

During the year, we submitted our radioligand therapy (RLT) Pluvicto (lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan) for approval in the US to treat patients with a type of advanced prostate cancer called PSMA-positive metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer in the prechemotherapy setting, underscoring the opportunity to expand the promise of Pluvicto to help more patients with prostate cancer.

Also in our RLT portfolio, we received approval in the US for Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate) to treat pediatric patients 12 years and older with somatostatin receptor-positive (SSTR+) gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). This approval makes Lutathera the first therapy specifically approved for use in pediatric patients with GEP-NETs, which are rare tumors found in the digestive tract.

Novartis is investigating a broad portfolio of RLTs, exploring new isotopes, ligands and combination therapies to look beyond GEP-NETs and prostate cancer and into breast, colon, lung and pancreatic cancer.

## Global health

We continue to advance potential new medicines for global health challenges such as malaria and leishmaniasis.

In 2024, we launched a Phase III clinical trial for ganaplacide/ lumefantrine (KLU156) for the treatment of patients with acute uncomplicated malaria. Ganaplacide/ lumefantrine is being developed in partnership with the WANECAM2 (West African Network for Clinical Trials of Antimalarial drugs) Consortium as well as the Medicines for Malaria Venture and their partners.

In partnership with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, we are also conducting Phase II studies of LXE408, a potential oral treatment for visceral leishmaniasis. We expanded the trial to Ethiopia in 2024 after launching in India in 2023.

## Operational performance

Novartis operates 33 manufacturing sites worldwide. As we execute our focused business strategy, we are expanding manufacturing capacity in key growth areas such as biopharmaceuticals and advanced technology platforms.

In 2024, we announced the construction of two new radioligand therapy (RLT) manufacturing facilities in the US to support growing demand for our RLT medicines. We broke ground on a new facility at our Indianapolis site for producing radioisotopes critical for RLT and we are establishing a new RLT manufacturing site - our third in the US - in Carlsbad, California.

The new facilities represent our continued investment in developing a robust infrastructure to support the expanding use of RLTs to treat cancer. These facilities will be built with room for further expansion to enable the potential production of different isotopes, ligands and RLTs. Once completed and approved, they will further strengthen the Novartis RLT manufacturing and global supply network.

Alongside our investments in RLT, we continued to advance our capabilities across our other strategic platforms, including increasing our cell culture manufacturing capacity in Austria and Singapore, and establishing a second viral vector facility and biological drug substance manufacturing using mammalian cell culture at our Menges site in Slovenia. We also started routine production of large-scale quantities of siRNA at our Schweizerhalle facility in Switzerland.

## Data science and digital technology

We are investing to build a strong data, digital and IT foundation for our company. As part of our overall strategy, we focus on priority projects that can be scaled globally and have the highest impact.

One focus area is implementing artificial intelligence (AI) use cases across our business. For example, through our strategic research collaboration with Isomorphic Labs, we have developed an AI model predicting protein folding to
reshape drug design. We are also exploring how AI can automate parts of clinical trial report writing.

As part of our AI strategy, we are empowering employees to leverage AI-powered tools effectively and securely to enhance productivity and decisionmaking. In 2024, we launched an enterprise-wide AI upskilling campaign for employees, which includes supporting the adoption of Microsoft Copilot. We also established a 'Data Science Academy' for data scientists and other employees.

# Environmental matters 

Our environmental sustainability strategy has three priorities:

- Planet: Achieve climate and nature targets, including net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040
- Patients: Develop sustainable products for patients, applying sustainable design principles for new products
- People and policy: Transform the sustainability mindset across our organization and collaborate with industry partners to influence change in our sector

Oversight of our environmental sustainability strategy, including climate and nature topics, ultimately lies with our Board of Directors. The Board has delegated certain duties and responsibilities to some of its committees, who report back to the full Board on their activities and findings.

At management level, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is responsible for implementing the environmental sustainability strategy. The CEO chairs the ESG Committee, a management committee on all ESG matters, that reviews the company's ESG performance and strategy.

Performance against ESG-related targets, including those on climate and nature, is integrated in the Executive Committee's compensation system as one of four equally weighed strategic objectives that account for $40 \%$ of the 2024 Annual Incentive. For further information on corporate governance, see page 48.

## Climate

## Impact and risk management

Climate change affects the planet and human health while presenting various risks and opportunities for our business. We have incorporated the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to strengthen climate governance, strategy and risk management processes, and to measure progress with relevant metrics and targets that align with our approach. ${ }^{1}$

Climate change has triggered, and may continue to trigger, the adoption of new regulatory requirements across the globe, as well as rapidly evolving societal expectations. Consistent with the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit the global temperature increase to $1.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ compared with pre-industrial levels, we aim to mitigate
our contribution to climate change. Failing to meet our commitments or societal expectations for climate mitigation could affect our reputation, recruitment, retention, operations, financial results and share price. We have a transition plan to become net zero by 2040 that will require significant operating and capital expenditures to implement.

Climate change may also require adaptations to our business. Increased heat and changes in air pollution may lead to changes in disease risk factors, resulting in both risks and opportunities for our portfolio depending on disease and geography, among other factors.

As many of our products are produced using technically complex manufacturing processes and require a supply of highly specialized raw materials, there is a risk of failures in the production and supply of critical raw materials. These risks are exacerbated by chronic (e.g., water and heat stress) and acute (e.g., cyclones, flooding, or drought) physical risks that can impact assets and activities along our value chain, with the potential for supply disruptions.

For more information see "Material topics" (page 16) and our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) risk factors on "Environmental, social and governance matters" (page 54), "Manufacturing and product quality" (page 55), and "Supply chain" (page 55).

## Climate change mitigation

## Main policies

We aim to reduce our environmental footprint to mitigate our impacts and become a net-zero company by 2040. Our near- and long-term ambitions have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) (see page 28). We have established a transition plan to achieve our near- and long-term targets. We measure progress using changes in climate-related indicators such as Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. ${ }^{2,3}$

To meet our near-term target, we are committed to using 100\% renewable electricity across our operations by 2025, following RE100 principles. ${ }^{3}$ Further, we are reducing energy demand through efficiency initiatives and process innovations, and implementing green technologies across our operating sites. We are transitioning our fleet to electric vehicles ${ }^{4}$ by 2030, in line with our EV100 commitment.

While we prioritize absolute emission reductions, we plan to neutralize any Scope 1 and 2 emissions from energy that remain in 2025, using a mix of high-quality biomethane certificates and nature-based carbon removal solutions.

Of the emissions associated with our business, 95% are generated outside our own operations (Scope 3). To address these emissions, we have been integrating environmental sustainability criteria in supply contracts since 2022 and aim to complete this for all suppliers in scope by 2025. We further engage with suppliers to support them in reducing their own emissions, and are leveraging partnerships to drive product and process innovation.

We systematically integrate life-cycle assessment (LCA) methods in our R&D pipeline to calculate and improve the environmental impact of our products.

We have implemented measures to reduce waste and emissions resulting from our clinical trials, and have obtained My Green Lab certification for 96% of our laboratories in technical R&D.

To accelerate progress across the pharmaceutical sector and other industries, we work closely with organizations that share our ambition to reduce the effects of climate change and nature loss, such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI), the Pharmaceutical Environmental Group (PEG), and the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI).

We apply a shadow carbon price of USD 100/tCO₂e in decisions on strategic capital expenditure over USD 20 million. This price is reviewed annually. We further factor climate change risks and opportunities into our financial planning by means of

### Our path to net zero

#### 2022 – 2030

- Demand reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions through efficiency programs, implementing green technologies, adopting renewable energy and transitioning to electric fleet where feasible
- Engagement with suppliers to reduce Scope 3 emissions, with focus on energy efficiency initiatives, process innovations and adopting green technologies
- Early product design considerations and decision-making to reduce product footprint
- Life-cycle assessments as basis for product specific environmental sustainability roadmaps

![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

#### 2031 – 2040

- Continue to innovate and execute decarbonization initiatives via external partnerships and supplier collaboration
- Leverage partnerships to drive product and process innovation
- Invest in high-quality carbon removals to neutralize unavoidable emissions in 2040 and beyond (~10% of our 2022 base year)

#### 2032 – 2033

- Scope 1 and 2 Scope 3 Neutralization

#### Notes:

Progress for our 2025 target is measured against a 2016 base year, while 2022 is the base year for our 2030 and 2040 targets. We will invest in biomethane certificates and nature-based carbon removal offsets in 2025 and beyond to achieve our carbon neutrality target.

budgeting to achieve our climate targets (see tables opposite).

We estimate the planned investment needed for implementing our net-zero transition plan based on three time horizons: medium term (up to 2030), aligned with our near-term target; long term (up to 2040), transitioning to net zero across our value chain; and maintaining net zero up to 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement.

To reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by $90 \%$ from a 2022 base year by 2030, we rely on green transport, energy efficiency initiatives, scaling up renewable electricity and thermal solutions, and operational improvements. To reduce Scope 3 emissions, we rely on supplier engagement, sustainable product design, lowcarbon procurement, and mitigation measures across the value chain. Our initial assessment indicates a substantive increase in operating expenditure until 2030, supported by targeted capital investment projects.

We assess the resilience of our strategy annually through quantitative and qualitative climate scenario analysis. Where applicable, we use climate scenarios that reflect low-, medium-, and high-emission pathways. Results from our 2024 scenario analysis show a potentially significant risk exposure from carbon pricing in the short, medium and long term. Carbon prices can affect Novartis as a direct charge on Scope 1 emissions or indirectly as higher overall costs passed through from suppliers. ${ }^{1}$

At the same time, prices for electricity generated from renewable energy are lower than those from fossil-fuel energy, presenting an opportunity from potentially lower operating costs through lower market prices, cheaper Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) or on-site renewable energy generation.

We can significantly reduce our exposure by implementing our climate transition plan. Considering recent progress, we have no reason to believe that we will not achieve our near- and long-term absolute emission reduction targets. The table opposite provides an overview of the anticipated financial effects.

We identified climate litigation as potentially significant in the long term. Climate change lawsuits can have negative effects on enterprise valuation. While there is a lack of evidence to date linking companies outside of high-emitting sectors to climate-related litigation, it is possible that companies in lower-emitting sectors will fall under the same scrutiny in the future.

## Main activities in 2024

In 2024, we continued our progress against our net-zero transition plan (see page 26). We deployed capital expenditure of USD 40 million on environmental projects to improve energy efficiency, adopt renewable energy solutions across our operations, and reduce consumption of natural resources. Our activities led to a reduction of our own emissions and those from purchased energy (Scope 1 and 2) by 20\% from the prior year and $71 \%$ from a 2016 base year.

In line with our SBTi-approved target boundary, we have reduced our Scope 1 emissions by $22 \%$ and our Scope 2 emissions by $72 \%$ from a 2022 base year.

In 2024, 96\% of our purchased electricity consumption was renewable, compared with $92 \%$ a year earlier, after sourcing renewable electricity for sites in several countries in Asia and South America, which are not included in the scope of our virtual power purchase agreements in

guidance to our suppliers on transitioning to sustainable business models. The playbook has been shared with more than 1000 suppliers and integrated into the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative's (PSCI) standard supplier learning plans.

We engage with key suppliers on their carbon footprint that contribute significantly to our Scope 3 emissions. We have so far onboarded and engaged with suppliers covering more than two-thirds of Scope 3 emissions.

In 2024, our total Scope 3 emissions decreased by 5\% from the prior year ( $13 \%$ compared with the 2022 baseline). ${ }^{1}$ The calculation of the purchased goods and services and capital goods categories, which account for $85 \%$ of total Scope 3 emissions, is still largely based on proxy data (spend) and statistical modelling through the Environmentally Extended Input Output model. The share of emission factors sourced from suppliers has increased to 33\%.

## Climate change adaptation Main policies

Our approach to climate change adaptation involves assessing the evolving challenges posed by climate-related shifts in disease patterns and their potential implications for our portfolio and sales. Additionally, we evaluate the potential financial impacts of physical climate risks on our assets, inventories, operations and supply chain, including risks of potential supply disruption that may result in lost revenue.

Shifts in temperature and air pollution affect disease patterns. This is likely to influence the prevalence and severity of certain health conditions, in particular cardiovascular diseases, respiratory conditions, kidney diseases, lung cancer, and communicable diseases such as malaria and dengue.

To understand the potential financial impact of these trends on our business, we have modelled the change in the disease burden of health conditions due to climate change as a proxy for changes in demand and hence in sales across three time horizons - 2030, 2040 and 2050. We used scenarios from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) on trends for climate-related, diseasespecific, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) from 2023 to 2050, together with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) intermediate and very low GHG emissions scenarios. ${ }^{2}$

Across all time horizons, on average we see a potential sales decrease for medicines used to treat ischemic heart disease and asthma due to expected declines in pollution levels. For lung cancer, results vary by region, with a potential decrease in sales driven by particulate matter levels in the US and Europe, and an

Time horizons for analysis of climate risks and opportunities

|  Time horizon | Period | Rationale  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Short term | Up to 1 year | Period adopted in our financial statements  |
|  Medium term | Up to 5 years | Aligned with our 2030 near-term targets  |
|  Long term | More than 5 years | Aligned with our 2040 net-zero transition plan and up to 2050  |

increase in the regions Asia, Africa and Australasia, and Canada and Latin America.

Meanwhile, across all regions, a potential increase in sales driven by climate-related factors could occur for renal diseases. This effect is expected to be most pronounced in Asia, Africa and Australasia, with a potential increase in sales of $2.7 \%$ to $2.8 \%$ per USD million in sales by 2050.

Climate-related events can also threaten the uninterrupted and timely supply of medicines that meet all product specifications and quality standards.

We have established policies and processes to support the quality and resilience of our supply chain and manufacturing processes. For instance, we have mitigated physical risks to our sites by putting in place infrastructure (e.g., shelters, flood defenses), supported by administrative procedures (e.g., business continuity plans). Further, we have an active energy management system to optimize energy consumption based on site-specific requirements.

As for our supply chain, its broad geographic footprint, dual supply for key products, and inventory level and stock policies make it resilient. In addition, suppliers are being required to follow environmental sustainability criteria that include the implementation of action plans with mechanisms to monitor and report on progress, mitigate risks and remediate failures.

To further assess the resilience of our operations and supply chain to changes in physical climate events, we conduct annual climate-related scenario analyses. In 2024, we assessed all Novartis operating sites and warehouse inventories for vulnerability to 18 physical climaterelated hazards across three time horizons (see table above). ${ }^{3}$ We used climate metric projections under three different IPCC socio-economic pathway (SSP) emissions scenarios that reflect low-, intermediate-, and very highemission pathways. ${ }^{4}$

Two chronic (water and heat stress) and three acute (cyclones, flooding, and drought) physical risks were shortlisted for financial impact analysis, which focused

We modeled these to assess potential financial effects on assets (property, plant and equipment (PPE) and inventories), net revenue, and operating cost (see page 65).

For acute physical risks, we assessed the proportion of assets at significant physical climate risk over the short, medium, and long term before considering climate change adaptation actions by applying wind-related and flood-related damage functions to sites (see table above). We found the highest exposure to flooding at our manufacturing sites in Bangladesh, Belgium, Italy and Switzerland; at our office sites in Argentina, Bangladesh, Canada, France and Japan; and at an R\&D site in the US.

To assess potential revenue at risk from effects of physical climate risk, we used site-level revenue estimates and downtime assumptions tailored to each risk. ${ }^{1}$ We found USD 40.8-59.8 million of our revenue to be exposed in 2025, rising to USD 188.6-228.3 million by 2050. However, with climate adaptation actions, we anticipate the actual revenue at risk to be considerably lower.

The analysis of our upstream value chain focused on assessing the current economic exposure levels to physical risk events. ${ }^{2}$ We found that 427 first-tier suppliers, representing $9 \%$ of our total third-party spend, are exposed to significant climate risk, including 12 with very high risk. In total, we found suppliers representing USD 119 million of revenue to be at risk. ${ }^{3}$

## Main activities in 2024

Our actions to ensure the resilience of our own sites and supply chain are regularly monitored through our enterprise risk management (ERM) processes. We capture impacts from climate-related and other environmental events through our health, safety, and environment (HSE) processes. In 2024, we did not experience any significant climate-related events.

To mitigate the exposure of our own sites to physical risks, we are implementing initiatives across our operations such as optimizing heating, ventilation and air conditioning, and upgrading to energyefficient equipment and improved building insulation.

To initiate site-specific action and strengthen business continuity plans, the detailed results of our climate-risk analysis (see page 65) across our operating sites were cascaded into our business operations. The results of our supply chain analysis were further cascaded to the relevant procurement and business continuity management teams.

## Nature

## Impact and risk management

The unsustainable use of natural resources can have negative long-term impacts on nature and society, and carries with it regulatory and reputational risk. While climate issues are better understood, with widely accepted approaches for action, those for nature are forming and evolving quickly.

We have begun assessing and evaluating nature-related risks and opportunities in our operations and upstream supply chain using the LEAP approach (Locate, Evaluate, Assess and Prepare) developed by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). We are assessing the role of biodiversity to complement water and waste as naturerelated pillars of our environmental sustainability strategy as our understanding of impacts, risk and dependencies matures.

## Main policies

We set minimum, mandatory requirements for the management of water, waste, wastewater and pharmaceuticals in the environment. Each part of the organization

is required to protect the environment by reducing risk; to ensure individuals are appropriately skilled, competent and fit for performing their tasks properly; and to comply with environmental regulation.

We seek to minimize discharge of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into water systems, and do not dispose of waste containing APIs in landfill.

We regularly measure water and air quality to make sure we remain within limits permitted by applicable local regulation. Sites with established regulatory limits, conditions or specific limitations on discharges are responsible for collecting data on a periodic basis.

Sites also perform an annual selfassessment of their controls, and the assessments of a representative sample of sites are tested by an independent governance team each year. Conformance reviews and legal compliance audits are conducted at least every five years.

## Water

We have a target to reduce water consumption ${ }^{1}$ in our own operations by half by 2025, compared with our 2016 baseline. Other water targets include having no water quality impacts from manufacturing effluents ${ }^{2}$ from our own manufacturing sites
and key API suppliers by 2025. This target has been complemented by a target for 2030 that also includes own labs and all API suppliers.

By 2030, we plan to implement water use reductions for own and supplier sites based in water stressed basins that have potential material impacts on these basins. We will set site-specific targets for both our own and supplier sites in these areas. Sites are identified through our nature assessment, which follows the TNFD framework and guidance by the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN).

## Waste

We have a target to reduce the amount of waste sent for disposal by half by 2025, compared with a 2016 baseline. To further reduce our impact, we have set a new target to reduce the amount of waste sent for disposal by 30\% by 2030, compared with a more recent 2022 baseline.

Further, we aim to eliminate polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a long-lasting plastic, in secondary and tertiary packaging at Novartis sites by 2025.

## Main activities in 2024

## Water

In 2024, we reduced our water consumption ${ }^{3}$ by $9 \%$ from the prior year,
bringing the reduction to $57 \%$ since 2016. With this we have met, and seek to maintain, our 2025 target. In 2024, we continued to reduce consumption by using more recycled water (where local regulations allow) and adopting less water-intensive production techniques.

As of the end of 2024, 97\% of Novartis manufacturing sites can demonstrate that they meet internal water quality standards. ${ }^{4}$

Further, we increased engagement with our manufacturing suppliers around their maturity in managing their impact on aquatic environments, particularly concerning effluents containing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). As a result, 100\% of our high-risk suppliers met our water quality standards in 2024, compared with $88 \%$ in 2023. These assessments are conducted in alignment with the framework to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR) laid out by the AMR Industry Alliance.

We have developed a plan to expand internal water quality standards to Novartis R\&D locations and all API suppliers in scope.

## Waste

In 2024, we reduced the amount of waste sent for disposal by $17 \%$ from the prior
year, bringing the reduction to $72 \%$ since 2016. With this we have met, and seek to maintain, our 2025 target. Further, we reduced the amount of waste sent for disposal by $23 \%$ since 2022 (our baseline for 2030 targets).

As part of our continued commitment to waste reduction and the use of recycled materials, in 2024 we improved process efficiencies and used more recycled plastics and reusable shipping boxes.

By the end of 2024, we had eliminated 100\% of PVC in packaging compared with 2016. Our 2025 target is applicable for 24 manufacturing sites handling final product packaging, all of which have already eliminated PVC in secondary and tertiary product packaging.

We have established a baseline for reducing plastics in packaging and devices and have continued to remove single-use plastics in workplaces.

## Biodiversity

In 2024, we conducted a nature assessment for own operations and upstream supply chain, aligned with the TNFD LEAP approach. In 2025, we will conduct further analysis to understand the impact on Novartis, the environment and society, including an assessment of

# Social matters 

## People and culture

## Impact and risk management

To execute our strategy, we need to attract, develop and retain the most qualified people at all levels and in all functions. If we are unable to do so, our ability to achieve our business objectives may be affected. In addition, our brand and reputation could be negatively impacted, and the sense of belonging of our workforce may decline.

Equally, as a global employer we have a significant impact on people, both within our organization and our upstream and downstream value chain. Our business generates employment with fair working conditions, and we provide extensive training and development opportunities and contribute to the wellbeing of our workforce. Meanwhile, investing in fostering belonging and a sense of wellbeing promotes innovation and better understanding of the unique and varied perspectives of customers, patients and other stakeholders.

Our efforts in these areas are essential for our ability to identify, attract, develop and retain a highly skilled workforce. In addition, occupational health and safety incidents can occur, resulting in negative impacts on the workforce in our operations or our value chain.

## Main policies Talent management

Guided by global principles, we seek to create a fair and inclusive work environment by building an inspired, curious and unbossed culture (see page 10).

Our People \& Organization Commitment Statement supports our commitment to fair and respectful treatment of employees and to their development and growth. It also outlines how we support our overall commitment to uphold human rights for employees, to treat them with dignity and respect, and to provide equal opportunities.

We measure employee engagement every quarter through a voluntary and anonymous survey. It is sent to all employees and carried out by an external vendor to ensure independence.

Aggregated results are used to identify potential risks and make improvements to working conditions, training and development, access to support programs and other areas where necessary.

## Training and development

We recognize that preparing for the future requires a workforce with a depth and breadth of skills. That is why we invest in the development of our people for current and future skills, offering access to
business-critical, personal and professional development training.

We also place emphasis on continuous learning, career development and employees taking full ownership of their growth, guided by their manager and supported through enterprise tools and solutions.

Employees can use internal AI-based platforms to manage how they learn, find new roles, and develop their skills and experiences through new projects, job rotations, mentoring or volunteering.

We invest in our leaders to strengthen their ability to lead and develop people, navigate complexity, and deliver collective impact. We develop our leaders based on their needs and role, through training programs and on-demand measures, such as individual coaching and team effectiveness resources.

Our approach to managing performance includes frequent check-ins between managers and employees on goals, career development, feedback and wellbeing. It is designed to focus teams on activities that create the greatest near- and longterm impact.

## Mental health and wellbeing

We offer support and learning tools to help employees care for themselves and others by prioritizing their mental health and wellbeing. Through global and local campaigns and engagement activities, we build awareness and de-stigmatize the conversation around mental health.

We maintain a Wellbeing Index, based on our quarterly employee engagement survey, which monitors perceptions of work-life balance and our commitment to wellbeing.

This data is used to customize our mental health and wellbeing offerings. For example, we have a training program for Mental Health First Aiders, who are equipped with the skills and confidence to have supportive confidential conversations with coworkers and peers, and guide them to the appropriate professional support if needed.

## Fostering belonging

To build a fair and inclusive workplace, we embed principles of fairness, equal opportunity, and belonging in internal policies and controls, including our Code of Ethics.

All employment decisions at Novartis are based solely on job-related factors, including the skills, qualifications, and experience of the individual, without

regard to gender, race, ethnicity, or any other protected characteristics, as defined by applicable local laws. Novartis, as a global company, complies with the laws of each country within which it operates.

Gender balance, which seeks to provide equal opportunities to both men and women and is a key element of our strategy for eliminating the gender pay gap globally, is an important part of our people strategy. This is exemplified by the commitments we made with the Equal Pay International Coalition (EPIC) in 2018 to help close the gender pay gap. These commitments included monitoring pay, excluding historical salary data from our recruitment processes, creating pay transparency, and achieving gender balance in management.

To sustain our progress, we renewed our EPIC pledge in 2023 with aspirational goals for 2027. These are: to maintain gender-balanced representation in management; to review our human resources practices beyond base pay to eliminate any further potential sources of bias from the system; and to make the requirements of the new EU Pay Transparency Directive our global minimum standard for pay equity and pay transparency reporting.

Novartis is a member of the International Labour Organization Global Business and Disability Network and the Valuable 500, promoting inclusion for people with disabilities in the workplace. We also collaborate with international partners, such as Disability:IN, Purple Space and Business Disability Forum, to identify and develop best practice solutions to enable people with disabilities to participate as equal members of our organization. Examples of this work include increasing physical and digital accessibility while integrating disability perspectives in relevant standards and practices.

In accordance with the UN Standards of Conduct for Business, we also strive to tackle discrimination against employees who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI).

More than 80 employee resource groups for business-related and cultural topics, which are open to all employees from all backgrounds, create a sense of belonging while offering members an opportunity for personal growth and development.

### Equal pay and benefits

Pay equity (i.e. paying employees fairly for similar work based solely on job-related factors) is a fundamental principle of our employment policies, reflecting a commitment in our Code of Ethics to treat all employees fairly and respectfully. In addition to our EPIC pledge, we are

committed to paying employees a living wage that meets or exceeds the amount for basic living needs, in line with our UN Global Compact commitment.

We offer a range of competitive local and global benefits. Our local Novartis retirement, health and welfare plans protect employees against the financial consequences of disability or death, and provide attractive retirement benefits aligned with local social security requirements.

Our Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) enables permanent employees to voluntarily purchase Novartis shares at a 15% discount. The plan covers a majority of Novartis employees and its rollout to additional countries is assessed annually.

We provide a flexible, hybrid work environment that allows employees to balance their professional and personal responsibilities.

Parental leave is available to all employees regardless of gender or sexual orientation. New parents get a minimum of 14 weeks paid leave following the birth or adoption of a child, ensuring greater flexibility for birthing and non-birthing parents.

Our global recognition program, Spark, encourages employees to recognize colleagues who have demonstrated behavior consistent with our culture and values.

### Health and safety

We are committed to occupational health and safety and have built this into our Code of Ethics. We have an internal health, safety and environmental (HSE) management system that requires the implementation across our sites of strict health and safety controls that go beyond legal minimum requirements.

We carry out assessments to ensure compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and internal standards. To monitor progress, we use internal targets and program goals, and investigate safety incidents and near misses.

We actively encourage all employees to report incidents, near misses and safety improvement opportunities. We require sites to carry out annual self-assessments of their implementation of the HSE management system and a dedicated team conducts more focused audits on a four-year cycle.

We are also committed to protecting the safety of third-party personnel. We assess outside contractors and make sure they have the right resources and procedures in place to be working at our sites. Supplier contracts include specific occupational health and safety criteria.

### Main activities in 2024

Novartis employed 78 310 people at the end of 2024, compared with 78 407 a year earlier. In 2024, employee turnover stood at 12%, down from 17% a year earlier.

## Pay equity and gender balance

We maintained a gender balance in management (providing equal opportunities for both men and women to advance), with women representing 48\% of our overall management globally at the end of 2024.

Based on the latest data available as of December 31, 2023, women's earnings at Novartis in the aggregate are within one percent of men's, with a global mean pay gap of $-0.3 \% .{ }^{1}$ This compares with a gap of $-0.9 \%$ in 2022. Companies in the benchmark Bloomberg Gender Equality Index had a mean pay gap of $+17 \%$ for the same period.

In 2024, we began reviewing our human resources practices beyond base pay to eliminate any further potential sources of gender bias from the system, starting with a review of global policies and procedures.

We also started planning a global program to make the requirements of the new EU Pay Transparency Directive our global minimum standard for pay equity and pay transparency reporting.

In 2024, we rolled-out an LGBTQI Ambassador program to provide allyship and support to our community across the organization.

The lost-time incident rate for employees remained stable and fell slightly for third-party personnel, reflecting the continued reinforcement of our internal HSE Management system at site level. In 2024, the implementation of the HSE system was reviewed via our internal controls process and this assessment covered more than $99 \%$ of Novartis employees.

## Human rights

## Impact and risk management

Noncompliance with human rights standards and applicable laws and regulations could result in negative labor and other human rights impacts, exposing us to reputational harm and financial losses.

## Main policies

Novartis is committed to upholding and respecting human rights. In our Code of Ethics, we commit to "conduct our business in a manner that respects the rights and dignity of all people." This is reflected in our Human Rights Commitment Statement, which establishes our foundational commitment to the International Bill of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization's core labor conventions and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).

We manage our program through three pillars, aligned with the UNGPs: due diligence, internal empowerment, and stakeholder engagement.

## Human rights priorities and key policies

## Right to health

Access to medicine; clinical trials; product quality; falsified medicines

## Labor rights

Freedom of association and collective bargaining; nondiscrimination and equal treatment in employment; occupational health and safety; living wages; child labor; modern slavery, including forced labor and human trafficking

## Human rights and the environment

Environmental impact of our operations and products over their life cycle

## Technology and human rights

Responsible use of personal information; ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI)

Due diligence: We conduct ongoing human rights due diligence across our business and ensure that we have policies and management systems in place to support our commitments. External partners are regularly assessed and monitored against the labor and human rights provisions set out in our Third Party Code.

We have a monitoring system in place that tracks remediation actions regarding human and labor rights at external partner sites, and their successful resolution through time-bound corrective action
plans. We collaborate with industry partners such as the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) on topicspecific supply-chain projects.

Internal empowerment: We work to provide access to grievance mechanisms for those who may have been affected by human rights abuses.

Stakeholder engagement: We engage across industries, listen to stakeholder concerns, and take individual or collective action. We also engage in collaborative

efforts with stakeholders from civil society, investor communities and international institutions (e.g., PSCI and Business for Social Responsibility's Human Rights Working Group) on our approach to human rights.

## Main activities in 2024

In early 2024, we completed our companywide annual human rights risk saliency assessment. This reaffirmed our focus on four previously identified priority areas, see the table to on page 37.

In alignment with the evolving regulatory landscape on value chain due diligence, we also enhanced our external partner labor rights due diligence and risk assessment framework.

We concluded a pilot project aimed at engaging directly with workers in our supply chain. This involved a comprehensive survey on working conditions. To address the survey's findings, we are actively providing ongoing capability-building support to strengthen our external partners' ability to implement effective solutions.

In 2024, we continued to develop human rights due diligence tools and processes to further support our operations in high risk and conflict-affected markets. These markets present unique challenges that require businesses to adapt their strategies to navigate and operate effectively.

We published a report on our efforts to address modern slavery under UK and Australian legislation, as well as reports on
child labor and conflict minerals in our supply chain under Swiss and US legislation, respectively. We also published our second human rights report under the Norwegian Transparency Act.

We periodically assess our obligations under Switzerland's provisions on minerals and metals from conflict-affected areas, and have established that Novartis falls below the thresholds stipulated by the Swiss Code of Obligations Art. 964j-I.

## Patient health and safety

## Impact and risk management

Trust in the safety of our medicines is fundamental to our business. If we are unable to ensure the quality and safety of our medicines, we may negatively impact patient health and face product recalls or other consequences that impact our reputation and our business.

## Main policies

We prioritize quality and safety at each stage of a medicine's life cycle. During clinical trials and after launch, we monitor the use of our medicines to identify possible adverse events and minimize risks to patients. In the production phase, we ensure product quality from raw material sampling and testing to packaging, testing and distribution of finished goods. We also work to identify and combat falsified medicines, which can pose a serious threat to human health.

## Product quality

To ensure product quality, we maintain a robust quality management system for our medicines in full compliance with requirements from health authorities and other regulators.

We have licenses and relevant International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Good Practice (GxP) certificates for all our activities, including clinical trials, manufacturing, medical devices, supply, warehouse and distribution operations. The licenses are typically issued after inspections by regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Swissmedic, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

Health authorities regularly inspect our facilities to ensure we are complying with all relevant laws and standards. We conduct thorough investigations whenever there is any evidence of deviation from these standards, or if we detect failures in our processes. We take corrective and other measures where applicable, including proactively notifying health authorities.

All employees and third parties working in our facilities take part in comprehensive quality and safety training. We require all employees involved in manufacturing, supply and distribution to attend annual training sessions on quality standards. All third parties providing services or goods
manufactured to GxP standards are required to have their own quality assurance and formal training process.

Following regulatory guidance (including FDA and EMA recommendations), we monitor chemical and biological medicines for impurities, including those classified as "probable human carcinogens" (e.g., nitrosamines). Any product identified with a potential risk undergoes further evaluation and risk management, with results submitted to the relevant health authorities as required.

We also routinely audit our own operations and those of suppliers and other partners to ensure quality standards and safety are maintained. Furthermore, we are regularly audited on our training procedures, and training is also included in our audits of third parties.

## Pharmacovigilance

Pharmacovigilance involves monitoring the safety of medicines. Our approach to achieve effective pharmacovigilance relies on safety monitoring both during drug development and in the commercial setting, as well as the timely assessment and reporting of adverse events.

This enables us to detect and manage pharmacovigilance risks that may emerge at any stage of a drug's life cycle. In accordance with international regulations, we share periodic safety reports with the relevant health authorities. We also perform regular benefit-risk analyses for


### Page 39 ###

our medicines to ensure their benefits continue to outweigh the risks.

Our pharmacovigilance systems are designed to comply with regulatory requirements for both individual case safety reports and periodic benefit-risk assessments. Reports of adverse events from various sources - including clinical studies, literature and spontaneous reports - are used to evaluate and optimize risk management actions for the proper use of our medicines.

We also support education programs for patients, providers and pharmacists, and provide regular training to employees in adverse-event reporting. For some medicines, post-approval studies may be conducted to collect more data on possible long-term adverse effects.

## Falsified medicines

Falsified medicines pose significant health risks and are a growing global concern. The Pharmaceutical Security Institute reported a 4\% increase in pharmaceutical crime incidents worldwide in 2023 - an increase for the third consecutive year. ${ }^{1}$

Our efforts to combat falsified medicines are focused on mitigating risks across three distinct areas: counterfeiting, theft and illegal diversion, where products intended for one market are intercepted and sold in another.

Our strategy is focused on greatly accelerating the timely authentication and reporting of counterfeit medicines. Trained local teams are equipped with mobile and digital field-testing solutions, including a mobile app (MoVe) for packaging verification and a hand-held testing device (Authentifield) for product authentication.

We also use intelligence tools and have equipped most impacted markets with toolkits to help them develop capabilities to mitigate the risks of illegal diversion.

Further, we have strengthened our supply chain security capabilities and governance to improve our ability to mitigate incidents of product theft in high-risk regions.

Overall, we continuously work with public and private stakeholders to encourage coordinated action on falsified medicines and protect patients' safety.

## Main activities in 2024

## Product quality

Over the course of the year, we experienced four recalls of nonconforming products, less than half the number in 2023. Of these, two were associated with moderate risk to patients (Class II recalls), though no patients experienced negative effects. Two batches of Pluvicto were recalled in the US before reaching patients due to a visual inspection error, and six batches of Tegretol were recalled at the request of the Panamanian health authority after we notified them of higher

than normal ethylene glycol levels. None of the other 81 countries notified requested a recall based on the favorable risk-benefit assessment.

In 2024, health authorities including the EMA, Swissmedic and FDA carried out a total of 124 inspections of Novartis clinical and manufacturing operations. All the health authority inspections were deemed acceptable, compared with $99.1 \%$ in 2023.

We conducted 809 internal and external GxP audits in 2024, compared with 926 in 2023. External suppliers accounted for $88.4 \%$ of the audits. Should we discover any gaps during the audit, the audited entities are expected to resolve these through corrective and proactive actions (CAPAs). We monitor these and track adherence to the commitments to drive continuous improvement.

We successfully completed our first ISO 9001:2015 surveillance audit in 2024 without any nonconformities.

## Pharmacovigilance

Novartis is working to transform its pharmacovigilance system, using technologies such as artificial intelligence to simplify processes and generate new safety insights for health authorities, healthcare providers and patients.

## Falsified medicines

In 2024, we investigated every confirmed incident of falsified medicines reported to us - preventing falsified medicines from reaching and harming patients.

Counterfeits, which often lack active ingredients, continue to be a significant concern and represent the highest patient safety risk. In 2024, we significantly increased the number of countries in which Authentifield devices are deployed and activated to 69, expanding our timely field product authentication capabilities from packaging (MoVE) to drug product (Authentifield). As a result, we conducted more field authentication tests on most at-risk products that impact patient safety.

This solution was recognized as a key initiative for building supply chain capabilities in the 2024 Access to Medicines Index (ATMI).


### Page 40 ###

We also maintained our commitment to the timely reporting of incidents of falsified medicines in 2024. We promptly notified local health authorities as required while also voluntarily reporting 100% of reportable incidents to the WHO within the recommended 10-day window.

## **Access to medicines: a shared responsibility**

### **Impact and risk management**

Millions of people worldwide face significant barriers to accessing basic healthcare services and medicines. These challenges stem from a combination of demographic, social, and economic disparities — ranging from aging populations and poverty to inadequate healthcare infrastructure and workforce shortages. While pharmaceutical companies contribute through the development of innovative treatments, addressing these challenges requires the collective action of a larger ecosystem. Governments, payers, NGOs, and community organizations must all work together to develop the policies, infrastructure, and partnerships needed to ensure timely access to healthcare services and medicines.

These systemic barriers also extend to the complex process of registering and distributing medicines globally. To bring a pharmaceutical product to market, a registration dossier containing evidence of the product's safety, efficacy, and quality must be submitted to regulatory authorities. Depending on the country, this process can take months or even years, influenced by the efficiency of the regulatory body and nature of the product. Furthermore, the negotiation of selling prices or reimbursement levels with regulators and payers often delays availability, while cost-containment measures — such as government-imposed price reductions and reference pricing systems — can further limit access to medicines.

Failure to tackle these challenges collectively risks not only delaying access to medicines for patients but also impacting public trust, reputation, and business sustainability. Therefore, a holistic effort — focused on patient-centered solutions, regulatory innovation, and shared accountability — is essential to bridging the gap between innovation and accessibility.

## **Main policies**

Our access policies are designed to ensure we do our part to address affordability, availability, and equity in healthcare, while recognizing that meaningful progress requires collaboration across the entire healthcare ecosystem. Our commitment is guided by the belief that innovative medicines and healthcare solutions should be available to all who need them, regardless of geographic or economic barriers. To achieve this, we integrate access considerations into the various stages of our work, from research and development to distribution and pricing strategies.

### **Research and development**

We systematically assess our R&D portfolio against unmet medical needs, integrating access considerations early in the development process. By the end of Phase II, we anticipate potential access barriers and enablers to ensure our investigational medicines have the potential to reach patients that could benefit the most.

Diverse patient representation in clinical trials is critical to our R&D efforts. Understanding how patients from different demographic groups respond to treatment is essential to developing effective and inclusive medicines. To this end, we incorporate diversity principles into all Phase III studies with US participation, aligning with FDA guidance. Our teams establish enrollment goals based on disease prevalence and demographic factors such as race, ethnicity, sex, and age to recruit a representative US population.

Additionally, we provide training for employees in R&D to ensure the inclusion of underrepresented populations in clinical trials, reinforcing our commitment to developing medicines that serve the broadest range of patients worldwide.

### **Access strategy for new product launches**

For each new product launch, we work to address non-clinical barriers that may hinder adoption and uptake. By


### Page 41 ###

collaborating with governments and healthcare systems, we develop innovative pricing and access solutions tailored to the needs of individual markets.

While we aim to make our products available globally, we recognize that access may vary by country. Factors such as regulatory requirements, healthcare infrastructure, and pricing frameworks can affect availability. In some cases, a product may be sold under a different brand name or be indicated for specific uses based on the needs and policies of a given country.

## Pricing of our medicines

Our pricing strategy is grounded in a commitment to value-based approaches that prioritize the needs of patients, healthcare systems, and society. By linking the price of a medicine to the outcomes it delivers, we strive to facilitate access to innovative treatments while incentivizing healthcare systems to focus on effective, efficient and sustainable interventions.

We work closely with payers to implement system-level mechanisms that align payments with measurable health outcomes, helping reduce ineffective spending. Where feasible, we also use tiered pricing models to ensure affordability across diverse geographies and patient populations.

## Intellectual property

Intellectual property (IP) rights are critical to our business as they safeguard the innovation and investment behind our
research, development, manufacturing and marketing efforts.

Strong IP protections incentivize innovators to pursue local regulatory approvals, a prerequisite for selling medicines in most markets. As a founding member and signatory of the IP principles for Advancing Cures and Therapies, we support thoughtful and balanced approaches to patent practices that aim to promote innovation while addressing global healthcare needs.

To ensure more patients have the potential to benefit from our medicines, we do not seek to enforce patents in least developed countries (LDCs, as designated by the United Nations), low-income countries (LICs, as designated by the World Bank), or in around 80\% of low- and middleincome countries (LMICs, as designated by the World Bank).

## Main activities in 2024

Our medicines are sold in approximately 120 countries worldwide. Across our portfolio, in 2024, our medicines reached 296 million patients around the world.

In 2024, we received 20 approvals in the US, EU, Japan and China, including US approval for Fabhalta (iptacopan) to treat adults with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), a progressive, rare kidney disease in which the immune system attacks the kidneys.

We received approval in the US and Europe for Kisqali (ribociclib) for use with
an aromatase inhibitor to treat people with HR+/HER2- stage II and III early breast cancer who are at high risk of recurrence, as well as approval in the US for Scemblix (asciminib) to treat adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP).

We made 29 submissions for regulatory approval in our key markets, including in the US for atrasentan, which has a different mechanism of action to Fabhalta, to treat IgAN, and in the EU, China and Japan for Fabhalta to treat adult patients with C3 glomerulopathy, another rare kidney disease.

We implement global access strategies for all new medicines launched. For example, our global access strategy for Fabhalta explores ways to partner with healthcare systems to expand access to this novel treatment for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

# Governance and integrity matters 

## Ethical business conduct

## Impact and risk management

Our commitment to high ethical standards benefits our people, patients and society by promoting trust, transparency and responsible practices. By embedding ethics in our decision-making, we strengthen our relationships with stakeholders and contribute to a fairer, more accountable healthcare ecosystem.

An ethical culture further reduces risks related to compliance, legal exposure, and reputational damage.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming industries, including ours, by enhancing business processes and supporting innovation. The rapid adoption of AI has created new risks, such as amplified biases, non-explainable outputs (black boxes), and automated decisionmaking processes requiring strong human oversight. We are committed to establishing a responsible use and development of AI within an embedded compliance structure.

## Main policies

## Ethical culture

Our approach is rooted in our culture and values, encouraging our employees to always act with integrity. We have a Code of Ethics, which is a fundamental part of the terms of employment for all employees of Novartis globally. It has been developed with our employees and is anchored in behavioral and decision science.

The Code of Ethics sets out commitments that are applicable across our business. It applies to all employees, and we further clarify our expectations through a suite of internal policies and controls.

We conduct mandatory annual training for all employees on our Code of Ethics. Internal online tools, such as our Ethical Decision Explorer, have been designed to help employees navigate ethical dilemmas.

In addition, we conduct a global Ethics Survey on a regular basis to measure our progress in embedding our Code across the organization and strengthening our ethical culture. We use insights it provides to drive conversations at global and local levels and take action where needed.

To maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing the risks, we established an AI compliance governance structure together with diverse teams to assess and address the complexity arising out of such
risks. This compliance governance structure helps us to mitigate risks within ethical guiding principles.

We have an Ethical use of Data \& Technology Policy that, together with the AI Risk \& Compliance Management Framework, contributes to the responsible use of AI across Novartis.

## Anti-corruption and anti-bribery

Novartis does not tolerate any form of bribery, undue influence and/or corruption. Our Doing Business Ethically and Conflict of Interest policies outline these expectations for all employees. We also clearly set out our standards in our Code of Ethics.

Our Doing Business Ethically policy and its supporting handbooks comprise a risk framework covering four requirements: (a) define clear objectives; (b) identify and assess the risk; (c) act appropriately; and (d) monitor, reconcile and learn.

To support implementation across our organization, the process requirements outlined in the supporting activity handbooks have been embedded within our BeSure system platform. This approach ensures that policy, processes and systems are integrated and can be monitored.

Bribery and corruption risks in our supply chain are addressed by our Anti-Bribery Third Party Guideline and Third Party Code. The Code is an integral part of every supplier contract. Our suppliers are regularly surveyed through audits that we commission from external companies, applying a risk-based approach.

Working with Norges Bank Investment Management, we helped develop an anti-bribery reporting standard for the pharmaceuticals industry that was issued in 2022. We report against this standard, which is based on principles such as the UN Global Compact and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

## Complying with laws, regulations and controls - our integrated assurance model

We have an integrated assurance model, which involves a comprehensive and consistent approach across the company to governance, risk management, compliance and internal controls. The integration is supported by an efficient operating model, processes and consistent methods, enabled by collaboration and data insights.

The integrated assurance model is driven by members of the Ethics, Risk and Compliance (ERC) function as business stewards, in collaboration with Internal Audit.


### Page 43 ###

As the basis of our integrated assurance system, we follow a model for managing our risks developed by the Institute of Internal Auditors that describes three lines of assurance.

Employees addressing potential risks that might arise through their business activities represent the first line. Secondline roles provide expertise, support, monitoring and challenge on risk-related matters. In the third line, our Internal Audit function provides assurance that other lines are operating effectively.

The Corporate ERC Assurance Team serves as the backbone of our second line of assurance, ensuring one functional standard for how we approach assurance, including internal review, external partner audit activities, and remediation.

Its scope comprises internal reviews of compliance with our Doing Business Ethically, Health, Safety and Environment (HSE), and Ethical Use of Data and Technology policies, guidelines and handbooks. Corporate ERC Assurance also initiates audits with external partners on anti-bribery, labor rights, and HSE.

Through our Enterprise Monitoring Coordination process, we avoid overlaps of activities carried out by different assurance functions, including Internal Audit.

As a third-line assurance function, Internal Audit assists the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee of Novartis (ECN) by providing assurance and advice
on the effectiveness, efficiency and adequacy of processes and controls that support Novartis in achieving its strategy, managing major risks, and ensuring compliance with applicable policies, laws and regulations.

Internal Audit works according to an audit plan approved by the Board's Audit and Compliance Committee. During 2024, Internal Audit carried out 52 audits. These include the review of ethical standards.

Our processes - such as Compliance Risk Assessment and Monitoring, Corporate ERC Assurance reviews, internal auditing, and the grievance mechanism - are designed to detect and prevent misconduct. Where evidence of misconduct is detected, we take swift and appropriate action. Breaches of the Code of Ethics, policies, guidelines or local laws result in remedial, corrective or disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

We adhere to industry codes, including the Code on Interactions with Health Care Professionals published by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Code on Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices published by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers \& Associations (IFPMA). We also work through regional and local industry associations.

Our policies and programs are informed by the United Nations (UN) Convention

Against Corruption and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials. We are a signatory to the UN Global Compact (UNGC).

We are committed to respecting and implementing human rights approaches in our own operations and supply chain in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).

The Chief Ethics, Risk \& Compliance (ERC) Officer of Novartis is also a member of the Anti-Corruption Leaders Hub, a leading group of senior executives from global enterprises established by the OECD and the US State Department.

The Hub promotes anti-corruption efforts through the exchange of strategic insights and the implementation of multistakeholder actions. The Chief ERC Officer is also Co-Chair of the Global Future Council on Good Governance of the World Economic Forum (WEF), serving a two-year term through December 2026.

Our comprehensive compliance management system is aligned with these recognized international standards and best practices, and is designed to prevent, detect and correct systemic misconduct.

The aim of this system is to ensure compliance not only with applicable laws and regulations, but also with our internal policies, controls, and the expectations of employees to do what is right. A core
objective of our compliance management system is to maintain a culture of integrity designed to promote and enable ethical behavior.

We continuously evolve this system based on many factors, including insights from internal and external sources and changes in the risk landscape. To measure the maturity and effectiveness of our compliance management system, we conduct regular evaluations of our program across more than 270 leading indicators.

Our annual global compliance e-learning provides content to enable employees to make the right choices in the course of their work, and to perform with integrity. Global mandatory compliance e-learnings are rolled out to employees, including the ECN, and to the Board of Directors.

External contractors, who are hired through a temporary staff agency and supervised day-to-day by a Novartis employee, are also required to take these trainings. We mandate external parties who pose a risk classified higher than 'low risk' to complete anti-bribery training.

## SpeakUp grievance mechanism

Employees are required to report actual or suspected incidents of misconduct and can do so in confidence while being protected against retaliation. The mechanism is also open to external parties. Regular surveys (Employee Engagement Survey and Ethics Survey) provide insights on how comfortable Novartis employees feel to speak up.


### Page 44 ###

Grievances can be filed via webform or telephone with an independent external service, which is available 24/7. Allegations can also be raised with any manager or Country President, any employee of our ERC, People \& Organization, Legal or Global Security teams, or any representative of the local workers council. Our process helps ensure that complaints are swiftly received, risk-assessed, prioritized, investigated and resolved.

Allegations that represent a higher risk to Novartis from a reputational, business, financial, legal, and/or quality or safety perspective are investigated centrally by dedicated investigators. Lower-risk cases are investigated or addressed locally.

After closure of an investigation, we have a remediation process that allows for both the allegation and the root cause to be addressed. Higher-risk cases that are substantiated undergo a central remediation process managed in close collaboration with our second line of assurance, the Corporate ERC Assurance team. This creates focus on ensuring that any remediation resulting from investigations is prompt, addresses the root cause, and is subject to follow-up.

The SpeakUp Office provides regular updates to the Executive Committee and to the Board's Audit and Compliance Committee.

## Cybersecurity

We have a cybersecurity risk management program designed to respond to the threat of security breaches, the threat of cyberattacks, and to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and continued availability of information owned by, or in the care of Novartis.

We follow industry best practices to manage information security. Novartis has risk-based services continuity and systems recovery plans in place for key business processes, which are tested periodically. We also conduct ongoing internal vulnerability analyses (including simulated hacking), as well as external testing via a third-party to ensure the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls.

As part of its enterprise risk management oversight, the Risk Committee of our Board is responsible for ensuring that Novartis has implemented an appropriate and effective risk management system and process, including annually reviewing updates on cybersecurity with the Chief Security Officer. For more information, see our Annual Report 2024.

In 2024, the evaluation of our compliance management system confirmed it to be mature and well designed. We also updated our Antitrust and Fair Competition Policy to ensure we continue to engage in fair competition and comply with antitrust and competition laws worldwide.

In early 2024, we launched our updated Trade Sanctions and Export Controls Guideline and implemented associated internal controls. The Guideline helps Novartis employees, contractors and other third parties better understand where breaches of export controls and trade sanctions might arise. It also supports employees in making the right decisions for our patients, our people and society. We published our second anti-bribery report in early 2024.

See "Supply chain management" on page 46 for more information on assessments of suppliers in 2024 as part of our External Partner Risk Management process.

In July 2024, we introduced the Anti-Fraud Policy to reinforce our commitment not to tolerate any form of fraud. This policy follows the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) Fraud Risk Management Guide that has a broad approach to fraud.

In November 2024, we introduced the Ethical use of Data \& Technology Policy with a communication campaign and mandatory training.

In 2024, Novartis did not experience any material cybersecurity incidents.

An update of our Business Continuity Management (BCM) and Novartis Emergency Management (NEM) Handbook provides our employees with additional details and guidance on how to implement BCM and NEM across Novartis. It helps us to ensure an uninterrupted supply of key products and services and to secure our key assets and business processes.

In 2024, we updated the Internal Review Committee Handbook, the Investigations Handbook and the SpeakUp Guidance.

We also launched the ListenUp and SpeakUp campaigns, under the umbrella of the updated Code of Ethics communication campaign. The ListenUp campaign aims to equip people managers to adequately respond to and address issues raised by their team members.

In 2024, a total of 1607 allegations of misconduct were handled by the SpeakUp Office, compared with 2059 in 2023. Of the total allegations in 2024, 946 (59\%) were classified as higher-risk misconduct allegations warranting investigation by a central team. In 2024, 921 allegations related to higher-risk misconduct have been substantiated. These include allegations reported in previous years and concluded in 2024. Lower-risk allegations are addressed or investigated locally.

We observed an increase in IT and data privacy allegations being substantiated in 2024, predominantly linked to data loss cases (allegations opened in 2023 were also included). The majority of data-loss cases are internally classified as higher risk allegations, centrally investigated and have a high substantiation rate due to automated detection measures. The number of substantiated allegations indicates that the detection measures are effective at identifying data leakages. We devote substantial resources to monitoring for and addressing these cases. In addition, regular mandatory training on information management, data privacy and data use is in place to raise awareness.

## Animal welfare

## Impact and risk management

Animal research is a necessary element in the development of new treatments in pre-clinical research to ensure the safety of clinical trials. The use of animals in research carries the risk of causing physical and psychological harm, including pain, stress, or suffering, to the animals involved. Failure to uphold high welfare standards can result in ethical concerns and undermine public trust.

## Main policies

We fully support the replacement of animals with alternatives wherever feasible, while meeting our obligations to patients and the expectations of regulatory agencies.

Our animal research is governed by our Animal Welfare policy, which applies to all Novartis-sponsored studies, whether internal or external. The policy commits us to applying the 3Rs principles - to replace animals with other methods where possible; to reduce the number of animals needed in our studies; and to refine study methods to minimize animals' distress.

We have a grant program to prospectively fund 3Rs research projects to validate alternatives to animal research, reduce animal numbers, and improve the animals' experience.

## Main activities in 2024

In 2024, we awarded grants for 3Rs research to several proposals, including projects to reduce the number of animals needed by enhancing genetically modified mouse model validation, developing multi-cellular spheroid models to understand dengue-induced hepatotoxicity, and using precision cut tissue slices for drug discovery. Additionally, we recognized projects aimed at improving rodent wellbeing through transitional lighting and sheltering rodents from bright light.

## Political engagement

## Impact and risk management

The laws and regulations relevant to the healthcare industry are broad in scope, are subject to change, and could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance, or to alter one or more of our business practices.

## Main policies

We engage in dialogue with policymakers and other external stakeholders on relevant policy topics, including conditions for innovation in the life sciences and expanding access to medicine. Our aim is to represent the Novartis perspective by providing data and insights that enable informed decision-making.

We assess political, legislative and regulatory decisions that have a potential impact on patients and our industry. Furthermore, we participate in policy discussions with partners through various stakeholder dialogues and industry platforms. Engaging with trade associations also facilitates a collaborative approach to highlighting and solving issues that affect people with disease, and to ensuring an environment conducive to

biopharmaceutical innovation. Our focus is on jointly creating solutions that help communities and society tackle the burden of disease.

The respective Novartis global guideline outlines the ethical standards that we follow in our engagements with policymakers and applies to employees as well as external partners working on our behalf. External partners are also subject to our anti-bribery due-diligence process as per our External Partners Risk Management Framework before they can be engaged. Appropriate training is provided to employees.

For further details, see the Public policy page of our corporate website.

## Main activities in 2024

In 2024, our primary focus areas included advocacy efforts supporting various initiatives and policies designed to advance healthcare, drive innovation and enhance accessibility.

These efforts involved, for example, engagement with European Union institutions through EU institutional policymakers with special focus on the Critical Medicines Alliance, Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, EU Pharmaceutical Legislation, Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, and the Patent Package. These efforts aimed to strengthen supply chains, advocate for regulatory and intellectual property protections, enhance EU competitiveness, and support environmental goals.

In the US, we engaged at both the federal and state levels to shape policies on drug pricing (e.g., the 340B program), the Inflation Reduction Act, and Pharmacy Benefit Managers reform. We emphasized engagement with policymakers, advancement of patient access, and efforts to uphold innovation and intellectual property protections.

## Supply chain management

## Impact and risk management

We rely on thousands of external partners for key business functions and services, which poses risks to Novartis, our stakeholders and the environment - for example when third parties fail to comply with our ethical and business standards or external regulations related to environmental sustainability, human rights and other matters.

## Main policies

Our external partner risk management (EPRM) framework enables risk management in a single, mandatory process and system as part of our integrated assurance system. The framework comprises governance, processes and internal controls, and applies a risk-based approach.

The due diligence efforts are applied in proportion to the level of identified risk, which is determined by the probability and severity of potential adverse impacts. We carry out risk assessments and selected audits among external partners in various risk areas including human rights; health, safety and environment; labor rights; information security; anti-bribery and corruption, and; business continuity management.

Our EPRM framework is supported by our Third Party Code, which sets out the standards we oblige external partners to comply with, including human rights and environmental sustainability. Our Third Party Code is consistent with the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) principles for responsible supplychain management. It is also in line with the UNGPs, as well as the OECD due diligence guidance for responsible business conduct.

## Main activities in 2024

In January 2024, we introduced a redesigned and largely automated process to risk assessments to gain speed, improve quality and cover additional risk areas (e.g., business continuity management and human rights risks related to certain raw materials).

All suppliers are subject to risk assessments when we engage with them and at a regular frequency thereafter. Suppliers flagged for high risk are subject to an onsite audit by our integrated assurance team.

Overall, we identified 2615 remediation actions with our suppliers. Of these, 302 were associated with human and labor rights. The increase of remediation actions in 2024 was mainly driven by new assessment categories added by the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI), as well as the finalization of legacy supplier assessments.

# Corporate governance 

Novartis is committed to effective corporate governance, and our corporate governance framework is intended to support sustainable financial performance and long-term value creation for our shareholders, patients, employees and other stakeholders based on our Values and Behaviors. For more detailed information on corporate governance at Novartis, see our Annual Report 2024.

## Our governance structure

Our primary governance bodies are the Annual General Meeting of shareholders (AGM), our Board of Directors, and the Executive Committee of Novartis (ECN). Each has different roles and responsibilities within our overall governance system:

At the AGM, shareholders approve dividend payments, maximum aggregate compensation for members of the Board and ECN, as well as financial statements, the nonfinancial report and other disclosures. They also elect the Board Chair, members of the Board of Directors, members of the Board's Compensation Committee, the Independent Proxy, and the external auditor. Shareholders meet at least once a year, usually in February or March.

Our Board of Directors has ultimate decision-making authority (for those decisions not reserved for shareholders). The Board operates through five permanent committees: Audit and Compliance (ACC); Compensation; Governance, Sustainability and Nomination (GSNC); Risk (RC); and Science \& Technology (STC). The Board represents the interests of all stakeholders and oversees the work of the ECN. It is in regular contact with the ECN through meetings and monthly CEO reporting.

Led by our CEO, the ECN is responsible for operational management, including financial performance, as well as fulfillment of the company's purpose, strategic priorities and targets. The ECN has 11 members, including the CEO and Chief Financial Officer, the leaders of our organizational units - Biomedical Research, Development, Operations, US and International - as well as those of other functions.

In addition, our external auditor provides regular opinions to management and shareholders on the company's compliance with applicable reporting laws, standards and requirements.

## Composition of the Board

All Board members are independent and nonexecutive (as defined under the Board regulations). Members are elected at the AGM for one year only; they may serve a maximum of 12 years.

When choosing new members to propose to the AGM, the Board aims for a balance of skills, expertise and experience. Twelve of 13 current Board members have experience in leadership and management. In addition, seven have experience in medicine, healthcare or R\&D, and four in environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics. The Board considers gender, age, nationality, ethnicity, viewpoints, professional background and expertise in its selection process.

The Board of Directors is subject to an annual self-assessment; every third year, this assessment is carried out by an external consultant. Board members receive regular briefings and trainings on ethics, risks and compliance, ESG and other relevant topics. In 2024, topics covered included the US healthcare ecosystem, our updated Code of Ethics, and data ethics and information management.

## Board highlights for 2024

During 2024, the Board of Directors discussed strategic, operational and financial issues:

- Oversaw the company's strategy to deliver high-value medicines that alleviate society's greatest disease burdens through technology leadership in R\&D and novel access approaches
- Reviewed the development of the talent pipeline in the context of strengthening the Company's foundations
- Discussed longer-term Board succession planning and required profiles, including the nomination of a new Board Chair and a new Board member for election at the 2025 AGM

# Risk management 

## Our approach

Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework is designed to generate a holistic view of risks for our company and drive a culture of informed risk-taking that advances our strategy.

Our annual ERM process is based on three main steps: understanding and adapting to the rapidly changing dynamics of our external environment; identifying, assessing and analyzing potential risks to the success of our strategy; and setting a clear risk appetite for each risk and taking actions to achieve our target risk exposure.

Throughout the year, we hold risk workshops with business leaders from countries, organizational units and global functions. This helps us integrate risk management into our activities and better understand our risk exposure through transparency on how key risks and opportunities are evolving.

Risk exposure is rated on a four-point scale - very high, high, medium, and low - based on likelihood and potential impact, using the 'most-probable worst-case' scenarios for each risk as reference points. We create mitigation plans and monitor each risk to achieve our target risk exposure.

Overall, our 2024 risk portfolio was similar to 2023. We continued to take mitigation measures to reduce our net risk exposure while updating our ERM framework and risk definitions to reflect changes in our strategic priorities and business environment taking into account risk amplifiers such as geostrategy, technology acceleration, climate change and evolving societal expectations.

## Risk governance

The Board oversees risk management systems and processes through its Risk Committee. Alongside senior management, the Risk Committee reviews the risk portfolio, prioritization of risks, and actions taken to manage or mitigate risk. It also carries out ad hoc reviews of key risk areas.

The ECN assesses risks and fosters a culture of risk awareness, in line with our Values and Behaviors and Code of Ethics. The CEO reviews and validates the annual risk portfolio. ECN members are appointed as risk owners for relevant strategic risks.

The ERM process is the responsibility of the Chief Ethics, Risk \& Compliance (ERC) Officer. It is managed by our internal Corporate Ethics, Risk \& Compliance organization within the ERC function, with support from risk leaders in key markets, organizational units and functions.

# Risks in detail

The table below provides further details on our 2024 risk portfolio. Further information on risks can also be found in our Annual Report / Form 20-F.

|  Risk | Context | Mitigation measures  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Strategic risks |  |   |
|  Pricing, reimbursement and access | Pressure on the pricing of our medicines has many sources, including increasing healthcare costs, funding restrictions, increasing pressure on intellectual property protections, and policy changes. Legislative developments in the US, Europe and other countries may create further pressures on pricing and the availability of our products. | We seek to price our medicines based on the value they deliver to patients, health systems and society. We believe this incentivizes health systems to focus on interventions that deliver the most effective, efficient and sustainable outcomes. We also work through industry associations to advocate for policies that support a sustainable ecosystem for innovative medicines.  |
|  Alliances, acquisitions and integration | As part of our strategy, we may acquire and divest products or entire businesses and form strategic alliances and collaborations to strengthen our pipeline of new medicines and help sustain long-term growth. The market for biologics and new technology platforms within our core therapeutic areas is highly competitive and there is a risk we will miss out on opportunities or be unable to fully realize the strategic benefits of these transactions. | We have strengthened our internal organization to streamline and focus decision-making by creating a new Strategy \& Growth function, single business development teams, and leadership teams for each of our core therapeutic areas. We have also implemented a single framework for portfolio assessment and prioritization.  |
|  Key products and commercial priorities | Delivering on our growth targets requires us to focus on priority brands and markets to support new launches and overcome potential barriers to the uptake of new medicines. This could be impacted by several factors, including (but not limited to) competitive pressures, changes in the prescribing habits of healthcare professionals, and slower than expected adoption after launch. Our commercial success depends, among other things, on effective transition of assets from development to launch, and sufficient market insight in pipeline and commercialization decisions. We operate in competitive and rapidly changing markets and could be adversely affected if we fail to keep pace with technological changes. | We have a clear strategic focus. We are aligning our research, development and commercial activities around priority assets in our core therapeutic areas and integrating new technologies such as Al into our commercial models. We are also focusing on priority geographies that represent key sources of growth in our industry.  |
|  Research and development (R\&D) | R\&D is vital to our strategy. Our ability to grow our business and advance our product pipeline depends in significant part on the success of our R\&D efforts. We may be unable to develop the necessary clinical evidence to achieve the full potential of our assets. In addition, failure to successfully implement new technologies such as Al may put us at a competitive disadvantage and impact our productivity and pipeline value. | We are focusing our efforts on core therapeutic areas and shifting more of our portfolio to new technology platforms such as cell and gene therapy, radioligand therapy, and xRNA. To do this, we need to have clear strategic objectives, be efficient and set clear priorities, with a focus on projects that have the highest potential. We also have a clear Al strategy and are investing in the enabling infrastructure, capabilities, and external partnerships needed to scale our most promising Al use cases across the R\&D continuum.  |
|  Environmental, social and governance matters | Increasingly, companies are being judged by their performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. Topics related to large societal changes such as climate change are increasingly important to a wide range of our stakeholders. Failing to meet our ESG commitments could adversely affect our reputation, recruitment, retention, operations, financial performance, and share price. | Building trust with society is part of our corporate strategy. We have developed an ESG strategic roadmap with clear targets on material ESG topics. We are also taking steps to further strengthen our approach to external partner ESG risk. We monitor changes to ESG regulations, particularly regarding new reporting and due diligence requirements. In addition, we have policies, controls and internal programs to ensure ESG is embedded in our decision-making.  |

# Compensation 

## 2024 company performance

Novartis delivered an excellent performance in 2024, driven by sales growth in key brands and more costeffective operations. Compared with the prior year, net sales from continuing operations increased by $12 \%$ measured in constant currencies (cc), core operating income increased by $22 \%$ (cc) and free cash flow increased by USD 3.1 billion. Sales growth was mainly driven by Entresto, Cosentyx, Kesimpta, and Kisqali. The Company's performance led to two guidance upgrades for net sales and three for core operating income.

The compensation of the members of the Executive Committee of Novartis (ECN) is largely determined by performance evaluations conducted on both a shortterm basis through the Annual Incentive and a long-term basis via the Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP).

In 2024, our innovation highlights included the approval of Fabhalta in EU, China and Japan for adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), as well as in the US for adult patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). We also received accelerated approval in the US for Scemblix for newly diagnosed patients with chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) and Kisqali was approved in the EU and US to reduce the risk of recurrence in people with early breast cancer.

The company's performance in 2024 resulted in a total realized compensation for the CEO of CHF 19165 899, of which $88.5 \%$ was made up of variable components, which comprised an Annual Incentive at 160\% of target and a 20222024 LTPP at 158\% of target. The LTPP represents the largest component of the realized compensation.

The 2022-2024 LTPP cycle delivered strong results versus target, with both third-party sales CAGR (compound annual growth rate) and core operating income CAGR (both in cc) exceeding the level required for a maximum payout. Threeyear sales performance from growth brands Entresto, Pluvicto, Kesimpta and Kisqali, all considerably exceeded expectations. Our bottom line was further strengthened through savings generated by our organizational transformation. Innovation performance was solid, as evidenced by the advances listed above. Our share price performance and year-onyear dividend increases resulted in a total return to shareholders of $54 \%$ over the performance cycle which ranked 5th out of our 15 global healthcare peer companies (including Novartis). In addition, the 2022-2024 LTPP cycle payout accrued a $15.5 \%$ increase in share price
between grant and vesting. In line with our plan rules, an additional two-year holding period applies for the CEO (and CFO) vested shares (i.e. until January 2027). The Board of Directors did not make any discretionary adjustments to the incentive outcomes.

The performance outcomes described above also contributed to the total aggregated realized compensation of the other ECN members which was CHF 56580414.

## Compensation system changes

At the beginning of 2024, the Board of Directors incorporated significant changes into our executive compensation system, which were shaped with input from our shareholders as described in detail in last year's Compensation Report. These changes were strongly supported at the 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM). We are confident that the changes place us in a better position to attract and retain the best talent on a global scale. No further material changes were made to the 2025 Executive Committee compensation system.

## Shareholder votes on compensation

As in prior years and in line with the Swiss Code of Obligations and our Articles of Incorporation, at the 2025 AGM, shareholders will be asked to approve the maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the Board of Directors of CHF 8200 000, which is lower than the amount requested in the previous term. This is due to the Board Chair fee change as well as the lower number of nominated Board members ( 12 members will be nominated for election at the 2025 AGM compared to 13 at the 2024 AGM). For the members of the Executive Committee, the maximum aggregate amount proposed to shareholders is CHF 95000 000, which remains the same as in the previous year.

Full details on compensation for the CEO, other Executive Committee members and Board members can be found in the Compensation Report of our Annual Report 2024, and in the compensation votes at the 2025 AGM.

## Description, methodology and results discussion

## Chronic risks

|  Water stress | Water stress measures the scarcity of regional or local water availability, and is increasing under the impact of climate change and human activity. Lower efficiency or a shutdown of water-intensive production
processes caused by such events could impact revenues.  |
| --- | --- |
|   | To quantify our exposure to water stress, we used "human water demand / water supply for the local and upstream watersheds". Our manufacturing sites in Pakistan, Belgium, Netherlands, Indonesia and China were
classified as high or very high risk for water stress.  |
|  Heat stress | Extreme heat conditions could increase operating costs by augmenting our cooling needs and energy consumption to protect the health of employees and ensure processes and equipment operate efficiently.
To quantify our exposure, we used cooling degree days indicating a need for air conditioning. Temperature rise is a significant risk across all sites. Heat stress exposure is most pronounced at our manufacturing
sites in Singapore, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, and is seen increasing at these locations by 2050. Heat risk increases from high to very high at our R\&D site in India, and at our offices and
warehouses in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malaysia, India and Saudi Arabia.  |

# Description, methodology and results discussion

## Acute risks

|  Cyclones | Cyclones and strengthened wind speeds can have potential financial implications through interruptions at our sites or via damage to our property, plant and equipment, and to our inventories.
To quantify our exposure, we used the Jupiter Intelligence metric "maximum 1-minute sustained wind speed (in km/h) experienced at the 200-year return period". Two of our manufacturing sites in Japan and Pakistan, one R\&D site in China, and four warehouses in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Philippines and India are exposed to high or very high risk of cyclones.  |
| --- | --- |
|  Flooding | With the increase in temperatures brought by climate change, flooding or extreme rainfall are set to become more common in different parts of the world. Flooding could lead to disruption or delays in manufacturing processes and interruptions in supply and distribution of products. Similar to cyclones, it could also result in damage to our property, plant and equipment, and to our inventories.
To quantify our exposure to the flooding peril, we used the Jupiter Intelligence metric "depth of the water (in meters) at the 100-year return period". By 2050, three manufacturing sites in Switzerland, Italy and Bangladesh were classified as very high risk, and two in Belgium and Italy as high risk. Three offices, in Bangladesh, France and Japan, were classified as very high risk across the time horizon, and one warehouse in India sees a significant increase in its risk classification to very high by 2050. Similarly, one R\&D site in the US is classified as high risk by 2030, in all scenarios.  |
|  Drought | Drought conditions are set to worsen in terms of frequency, length and severity due to the impact of climate change. They could potentially impact revenue through business interruption, should these events lead to temporary site closures.
To quantify our exposure to the drought peril, we used a metric that characterizes extreme meteorological drought conditions, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), more specifically "months per year where the rolling 6-month average SPEI is below -2". Four of our manufacturing sites with low baseline risk - in Egypt, Belgium, Netherlands and Turkey - are classified as high risk in a middle-of-the-road SSP2-4.5 scenario by 2040. By 2050, in a very high emissions SSP5-8.5 scenario, 16 manufacturing sites are at high or very high risk. Meanwhile offices and warehouses that are already classified as high risk in countries including Greece, Israel and Turkey, become very high risk by 2050.  |

## Physical risks - supply chain

|  Time horizons | Short term  |
| --- | --- |
|  Data sources | Country Index data from the University of Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN, 2023); asset tangibility data from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2021); Oxford Economics database and models; Novartis procurement spend and data  |
|  Coverage | Entire Novartis procurement spend  |
|  Risks considered | ND-GAINS draws on more than 40 indicators to measure current vulnerability to disruptions and readiness to leverage private and public sector investment for adaptive actions ${ }^{1}$  |
|  Financial impact | Revenue: We mapped the revenue contribution of our tier 1 suppliers in conjunction with physical climate risk assessment from ND-GAIN  |
|   | Description, methodology and results discussion  |
|  Physical risk | To estimate the supply chain spend exposed to physical climate risk, we measured total procurement spend for 2023 and assessed supplier data for materiality using the criteria spend, asset tangibility (dependence on physical assets) and substitutability (existence of alternative suppliers). Shortlisted suppliers were assessed for climate risks using ND-GAIN data (2023), which measures country-level vulnerability and readiness based on over 40 indicators. OECD data (2021) on asset tangibility was used to gauge sector vulnerability. Country and sector risk scores were combined to produce a final score from 1 to 25 , categorized from very low ( $<3$ ) to very high ( $>15$ ). Suppliers with high and very high risk, as well as suppliers with medium risk but high asset tangibility, were retained in the analysis.  |

# Transition risks and opportunities

|  Risks considered | We assessed 18 risks and opportunities ${ }^{1}$ out of a longlist of 33 factors for impact materiality to Novartis. We drew up a shortlist of transition risks and opportunities for both climate mitigation and adaptation, and grouped these into three categories: litigation and reputational risk (qualitative assessment), carbon pricing and switch to low-carbon alternatives (quantitative), and changing demand for healthcare (quantitative).  |
| --- | --- |
|  Carbon pricing, carbon certificates pricing and electricity costs |   |
|  Emissions scenarios for transition risk analysis | - Carbon pricing, electricity costs: - IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE), a normative scenario describing a pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and an emissions trajectory consistent with keeping temperature rise in 2100 below $+1.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; - IEA Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), describing energy system progression based on the assumption that all targets, pledges and announcements are to be achieved on time and in full, consistent with keeping temperature rise in 2100 below $+1.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; - IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), describing energy system progression based on the IEA assessment of current policies and other market circumstances, consistent with keeping temperature rise in 2100 below $+2.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
- Carbon certificates pricing: - Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) voluntary market scenario (inelastic demand); BNEF's BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) offset cost scenario; BNEF high-quality bifurcation scenario (inelastic demand) and BNEF's direct air capture offset cost scenario  |
|  Time horizons | Medium term (2030), Long term (2040), Long term (2050)  |
|  Data sources | IEA Global Energy and Climate (GEC) Model scenarios; IEA carbon prices, levelized cost of energy (LCOE) costs, electricity generation, World Energy Outlook 2023 \& 2024; BNEF long-term carbon offsets outlook  |
|  Coverage | - Carbon pricing: full Scope 1 and 2 coverage across Novartis sites and purchased energy; >84\% of Scope 3 (category 1, purchased goods and services, and category 2, capital goods)
- Carbon certificates pricing: full Scope 1, 2 and 3 coverage
- Electricity costs: electricity consumed by Novartis sites globally  |
|   | Description, methodology and results discussion  |
|  Carbon pricing | Carbon prices, in the form of emissions trading or carbon taxes, are likely to continue to increase in major operating and supplier countries, which may lead to rising operating costs for Novartis. Carbon pricing can impact Novartis as 1) a direct charge on Scope 1 emissions that fall under emissions schemes such as the EU ETS, 2) via purchased energy as a pass-through cost from electricity generators; 3) as a charge on emissions of suppliers who pass through part of their costs to Novartis, and 4) as a charge to buy the necessary Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) certificates for the emissions embedded in Novartis imports.
To quantify our Scope 1 and 2 exposure to carbon pricing, we followed five steps: 1) we assigned carbon prices (IEA World Energy Outlook 2023 forecast prices) across the time horizon and scenarios to each country in which we had Scope 1 or 2 emissions; 2) we measured Scope 1 and 2 emissions by country; 3) we multiplied Scope 2 emissions by 100\%, assuming a 100\% pass-through rate from electricity suppliers; 4) we multiplied Scope 1 and 2 emissions by the corresponding country-level carbon price forecast; and 5) we multiplied the resulting carbon costs by our Scope 1 and 2 SBTi emissions reduction targets for 2030 (90\%) and 2040 (90\%), assuming we maintain emissions at the 2040 level also by 2050. This approach assumed that all sites have to pay the full carbon price and all site emissions are covered by the carbon price.
Across all the jurisdictions considered in the analysis, the risk was highest in the following countries, due both to high carbon prices and country-level total emissions: US, Austria, Slovenia, Italy, France, Singapore, UK, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland.
To quantify our Scope 3 exposure to carbon pricing, we followed similar steps: 1) we measured country-level Scope 3 emissions data for our Category 1 (purchased goods and services) and Category 2 (capital goods) supplies, representing more than $85 \%$ of our Scope 3 emissions; 2) we assigned carbon prices (IEA World Energy Outlook 2023 forecast prices) across the time horizon and scenarios to each country; 3) we multiplied Scope 3 emissions by $70 \%$, assuming a $70 \%$ pass-through rate from our suppliers; 4) we multiplied Scope 3 emissions by the corresponding country-level carbon price forecast; 5) we multiplied the resulting carbon costs by our Scope 3 SBTi emissions reduction targets for 2030 (42\%) and 2040 (90\%), assuming we maintain emissions at the 2040 level also by 2050; and 6) we estimated the percentage of our Scope 3 emissions imported to the EU in our baseline year, and using a sector-based approach, we assumed which percentage of these may gradually become subject to the CBAM across the time horizon, using the difference between the EU carbon price and the respective country's carbon price to calculate the impact.  |
|  Carbon certificates pricing | To meet our emission targets, our primary focus is on absolute reductions. For our 2025 target of carbon neutrality from energy in own operations, however, we will invest in carbon removal offsets for residual Scope 1 and 2 emissions. For our 2040 net-zero targets, we will align with SBTi's Corporate Net-Zero standard requirements for offsets e.g. max 10\% of Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions.
Novartis has an offsets outlook determined by a) the credit volumes required to meet its emissions reduction targets (2025, 2030 and 2040), b) the preferred contribution of nature-based solutions vs engineering removals to the total volume, across the time horizon and c) its opted-in offset prices.
To calculate the potential risk or opportunity associated with our offsets outlook up to 2050, we stress-tested our baseline outlook against Bloomberg New Energy Finance offset price forecasts (BNEF) to 2050. Keeping the same relative nature-based solutions (NbS) vs engineering removal contribution as in our baseline, and the same volume of offsets required, we used the following BNEF forecasts: for the low price scenario - BNEF's voluntary market (assuming inelastic demand) for NbS offsets and BNEF's BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) offset cost for engineering removals; for the high price scenario BNEF's high-quality bifurcation scenario (inelastic demand) for NbS offsets and the BNEF direct air capture offset cost for engineering removals.  |

|   | Description, methodology and results discussion |  |  |  |   |
|  Electricity costs | Prices for electricity generated from renewable energy are lower than those from fossil fuel energy and are expected to fall further. This may result in lower operating costs from electricity use, either through lower market prices, cheaper power purchase agreements (PPAs) or onsite renewable energy generation. |  |  |  |   |
|   | To calculate this transition opportunity, changes in different electricity technology costs over time were applied to the respective electricity grid mix in each climate scenario. The model uses country-level IEA electricity generation data to show how the power mix changes in the different scenarios. It uses 2030 and 2050 IEA changes in levelized costs of energy (LCOE) as a proxy for changes in average costs of electricity in all countries. |  |  |  |   |
|   | In all scenarios, renewables increase their share in the generation mix while their LCOEs decrease. The opportunity is measured as the percentage difference between the current electricity costs in each country and the electricity costs associated with the future grid. |  |  |  |   |
|   | The model separately assumes that Novartis meets its 100% renewables target by 2025 and maintains it thereafter. |  |  |  |   |
|   | Our final results show the additional cost savings, beyond those incurred already from the changes in the future electricity grid, by subtracting these from the changes incurred from switching to 100% renewables.1 |  |  |  |   |
|  Changing demand for healthcare |  |  |  |  |   |
|  Scenarios considered | IPCC SSP1-1.9 (very low emissions scenario, central estimate for temperature rise by 2100 +1.4°C); IPCC SSP2-4.5 (intermediate emissions scenario, central estimate for temperature rise by 2100 +2.7°C); Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) scenarios "Reference" and "Safer Environment" from 2021 |  |  |  |   |
|  Time horizons2 | Baseline, Medium term (2030), Long term (2040), Long term (2050) |  |  |  |   |
|  Data sources | IHME's Global Burden of Disease (GBD, 2021) database and other scientific literature, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), internal Novartis sales |  |  |  |   |
|  Coverage | Ischemic heart disease, asthma, lung cancer, chronic kidney disease due to glomerulonephritis |  |  |  |   |
|  Changing demand for healthcare | Factors including changing temperature and pollution patterns are increasingly being analyzed for their correlation to the prevalence or severity of some diseases. |  |  |  |   |
|   | To measure our exposure to such changes, we started with a longlist of products (top growth commercial products up to 2030 and our pipeline), and used IHME and other scientific literature to establish whether climate risk (temperature/pollution) is significant for the diseases treated by the respective products. Where there was a correlation, products were shortlisted for further analysis, along with other Novartis products treating a similar disease. These products were used as a proxy to determine climate-related demand associated with the disease area. |  |  |  |   |
|   | Across all time horizons modelled, on average we see a potential sales decrease for medicines used to treat ischemic heart disease, asthma and lung cancer, due to expected declines in pollution levels. For lung cancer, results vary by region, with a decrease in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) related to particulate matter in the US and Europe, and an increase in the regions Asia, Africa and Australasia, and Canada and Latin America. Meanwhile, across all regions, there is an opportunity to increase sales for products used to treat renal diseases, with the effect most pronounced in Asia, Africa and Australasia. |  |  |  |   |
|   | For each disease area, we calculated the percentage of climate-related DALYs out of total DALYs, and multiplied this by country-level product sales to generate a climate-related sales baseline. To calculate how this might change, we multiplied the climate-related sales baseline by the percentage change in climate-related DALYs vs baseline across the time horizons and scenarios. For pipeline products, we calculated the revenue impact based on every future USD 1 million sales for the product in one year. |  |  |  |   |

^{1} The potential savings in electricity costs exclude the impact associated with our direct consumption of fuel (e.g. natural gas), primarily used to generate thermal energy

^{2} We do not expect material risk in the short term from climate-related changes in demand for healthcare.

# Independent practitioner's limited assurance report on selected Sustainability Information of Novartis AG 

## To the Board of Directors of Novartis AG

We have undertaken a limited assurance engagement on Novartis AG's (hereinafter "Novartis") Sustainability Information on pages 28, 30, 32, 35, 40, and 60 to 62 marked with the symbol $\Delta$ (hereinafter "Sustainability Information") in the Novartis in Society Integrated Report for the year ended December 31, 2024 (the "Report").

Our assurance engagement does not extend to information in respect of earlier periods or to any other information included in the Report, the Novartis Annual Report, Form 20-F or displayed elsewhere on Novartis's website for the current year or for previous periods unless otherwise indicated, including any images, audio files or embedded videos.

## Understanding how Novartis has Prepared the Sustainability Information

Novartis prepared the Sustainability Information using criteria as outlined here (hereinafter "Reporting Criteria"). The Reporting Criteria have been developed to assist Novartis in preparing the performance information for selected ESG performance indicators, and for ESG performance indicators used to measure progress against its ESG targets. Consequently, the Sustainability Information needs to be read and understood together with the Reporting Criteria. As a result, the Sustainability

Information may not be suitable for another purpose.

## Our Limited Assurance Conclusion

Based on the procedures we have performed as described under the 'Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our assurance conclusion' and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Information in the Report for the year ended 31 December 2024 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.

Our conclusion is to be read in the context of the remainder of this report, in particular the "Inherent limitations in preparing the Sustainability Information" and "Intended use and distribution of our report" sections below.

We do not express an assurance conclusion on information in respect of earlier periods or on any other information included in the Report, Novartis Annual Report or Form 20-F, including any images, audio files or embedded videos.

## Inherent Limitations in Preparing the Sustainability Information

Due to the inherent limitations of any internal control structure, it is possible that errors or irregularities may occur in disclosures of the Sustainability Information and not be detected. Our engagement is not designed to detect all internal control weaknesses in the
preparation of the Sustainability Information because the engagement was not performed on a continuous basis throughout the period and the assurance procedures performed were on a test basis.

The nature of non-financial information; the absence of significant body of established practice on which to draw; and the methods of precision used to determine non-financial information, allow for different, but acceptable evaluation and measurement techniques and can result in materially different measurement, affecting comparability between entities and over time.

## Novartis's Responsibilities

The Board of Directors of Novartis is responsible for:

- Selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting the Sustainability Information;
- The preparation of the Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement in accordance with the Reporting Criteria;
- Designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the preparation of the Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and
- The contents and statements contained within the Report and the Reporting Criteria.


## Our Responsibilities

We are responsible for:

- Planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
- Forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and
- Reporting our conclusion to the Board of Directors of Novartis AG.

As we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Sustainability Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of the Sustainability Information as doing so may compromise our independence.

## Professional Standards Applied

We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board ("IAASB") and, in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions information included within the


### Page 73 ###

Sustainability Information, in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the IAASB.

## Our Independence and Quality Control

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' ("IESBA") International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.

Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Our work was carried out by an independent and multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners and sustainability experts. We remain solely responsible for our assurance conclusion.

## Summary of the Work we Performed as the Basis for our Assurance Conclusion

We are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas where we have identified that a material misstatement of the Sustainability Information is likely to arise. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. Carrying out our limited assurance engagement on the Sustainability Information included, among others:

- Inquiries of employees responsible for the determination and consolidation as well as the implementation of internal control procedures regarding the Sustainability Information;
- Inspection of selected internal and external documents to determine whether qualitative and quantitative information is supported by sufficient evidence and presented in an accurate and balanced manner;
- Assessment of the data collection, validation and reporting processes as well as the reliability of the reported data on a test basis and through testing of selected calculations;
- Analytical assessment of the data and trends of the Sustainability Information included in the scope of the limited assurance engagement;
- Considering the appropriateness of the carbon conversion factor calculations and other unit conversion factor calculations used by reference to widely recognised and established conversion factors;
- Reading the narrative within the Report with regards to the Reporting Criteria, and for consistency with our findings; and
- Evaluating whether Novartis's methods for developing key estimates were appropriate and had been consistently applied.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement.

## Intended Use and Distribution of our Report

Our report has been prepared for Novartis solely in accordance with the terms of our engagement. We have consented to the publication of our report within the Novartis in Society Integrated Report for the purpose of Novartis showing that it has obtained an independent assurance report in connection with the Sustainability Information.

Our report was designed to meet the agreed requirements of Novartis determined by Novartis's needs at the time. Our report should not therefore be regarded as suitable to be used or relied on by any party wishing to acquire rights against us other than Novartis for any purpose or in any context. Any party other than Novartis who obtains access to our report or a copy and chooses to rely on our report (or any part of it) will do
so at its own risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law, KPMG AG will accept no responsibility or liability in respect of our report to any other party.
