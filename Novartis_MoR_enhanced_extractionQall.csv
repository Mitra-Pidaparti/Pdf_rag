For example, patents in the US can be challenged in the USPTO through various proceedings, including inter partes review (IPR) and post-grant review (PGR) proceedings. They may also be challenged through patent infringement litigation under the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act or under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). In the EU, patents may be challenged through oppositions in the EPO, revocation actions before the Unified Patent Court, or national patents may be challenged in national courts or national patent offices. The outcomes of such challenges can be difficult to predict. In addition to directly challenging our IP rights, in some circumstances a competitor may be able to market a generic version of one of our products by, for example, designing",39,Third-party patents and challenges to intellectual property,combined_novartis_chunk_0195,0.0015,-11.2073,-7.8447,1,0.0,-7.8447,80,tfidf:0.193

To manage this risk, the Company periodically assesses country and customer credit risk, assigns individual credit limits, and takes actions to mitigate credit risk where appropriate (for example payment guarantees, credit insurance and factoring). The provisions for expected credit losses for customers are based on a forward-looking expected credit loss, which includes possible default events on the trade receivables over the entire holding period of the trade receivables. In measuring the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics (such as private versus public receivables) and days past due.

Our most recent materiality assessment, conducted in 2021, reflects the input of more than 500 external and 12 000 internal stakeholders. Respondents were asked to estimate the impact of Novartis on eight separate topic areas. The chart opposite shows the results. External stakeholders were drawn from our main stakeholder groups, including patients, customers, partners, and shareholders.

Our access policies are designed to ensure we do our part to address affordability, availability, and equity in healthcare, while recognizing that meaningful progress requires collaboration across the entire healthcare ecosystem. Our commitment is guided by the belief that innovative medicines and healthcare solutions should be available to all who need them, regardless of geographic or economic barriers. To achieve this, we integrate access considerations into the various stages of our work, from research and development to distribution and pricing strategies. ### **Research and development**
