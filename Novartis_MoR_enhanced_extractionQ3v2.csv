The table below provides a summary of share grants (shares, RSs, RSUs and PSUs) for all plans. At the Sandoz 
Distribution date, all RSU and PSU holders, who were not entitled to the dividend in kind in the form of Sandoz Group 
AG shares received “keep whole awards” in Novartis AG shares to compensate for the loss of the Sandoz value 
from their Novartis AG shares. These keep whole awards were accounted for as a modification, which did not sig-
nificantly change the fair value of the original grant. The change in fair value was measured by comparing the fair 
value of the grant before the spin-off against the fair value of the grant plus keep whole award right after spin-off. 2024 2023 Weighted Weighted Number average fair Number average fair of shares value at grant of shares value at grant in millions date in USD in millions date in USD Annual Incentive – RSU 0.2 96.7 0.3 74.2 – Restricted shares 0.1 107.8 0.1 92.3 Share savings plans – RSU 0.5 96.8 0.4 71.3 ",229,,page229_chunk002,0.0001,-11.3213,-7.9249,1,0.0,-7.9249,128,tfidf:0.017

Nature  
• An aspirational, enduring reason for being – it expresses why the company exists beyond making medicines or generating profits.  
• Mission-like: it guides strategy, culture, capital allocation and day-to-day decisions.

Focus  
• Patient and societal impact – improving health outcomes and quality of life for people everywhere.  
• Innovation – “re-imagine” signals a commitment to scientific and technological breakthroughs rather than incremental change.  
• Access and scale – extending lives implies not only discovering new therapies but also making them broadly available.  
• Long-term value creation – while financial success is required, the primary focus is on meaningful medical advances that benefit patients, healthcare systems and society.","38

quarter through a voluntary and

Risk management
Our approach
Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
framework is designed to generate a 
holistic view of risks for our company and 
drive a culture of informed risk-taking that 
advances our strategy. Our annual ERM process is based on three 
main steps: understanding and adapting to 
the rapidly changing dynamics of our 
external environment; identifying, 
assessing and analyzing potential risks to 
the success of our strategy; and setting a 
clear risk appetite for each risk and taking 
actions to achieve our target risk exposure. Throughout the year, we hold risk 
workshops with business leaders from 
countries, organizational units and global 
functions. This helps us integrate risk 
management into our activities and better 
understand our risk exposure through

Assets separately acquired are recorded at cost, which 
includes the purchase price and any directly attributable 
costs for bringing the asset into the condition to operate 
as intended. Expected costs for obligations to disman-

the site when it is no longer used are included in their

the acquisition method, unless the optional concentra-

basis to account for the acquired business as an asset 
separately acquired when substantially all of the fair

business, as well as certain expenses related to the spin-
off (the “Sandoz business”) to be reported as discontin-
ued operations. The shareholder approval on September 15, 2023, 
for the spin-off the Sandoz business, required the rec-
ognition of a distribution liability at the fair value of the 
Sandoz business. Novartis policy is to measure the dis-
tribution liability at the fair value of the Sandoz business 
net assets taken as a whole. The distribution liability was 
recognized through a reduction in retained earnings. It 
was required to be adjusted at each balance sheet date 
for changes in its estimated fair value, up to the date of 
the distribution to shareholders through retained earn-
ings. Any resulting impairment of the business assets to 
be distributed would have been recognized in the con-
solidated income statements in “Other expense” of dis-

Financial targets: When assessing performance, achievements for threshold, target and maximum payout are 
defined for each metric, and a payout curve is applied to determine the corresponding payout between 0‑200% 
against target. Innovation: At the end of the cycle, the Compensation Committee determines, following input from the STC, 
the payout factor based on the number of relevant clinical milestones achieved against the target score. Relative TSR: Performance on TSR is assessed relative to our global healthcare peer group, as outlined 
below. A three-month averaging method is used for both the start and the end of the performance cycle. Companies are then ranked in order of highest to lowest TSR in USD. No payout for below median TSR 
applies. The Board of Directors may use its discretion on each metric, including deciding on the payout within the 
ranges where appropriate. In doing so, it takes into consideration factors such as the underlying assumptions

pharmaceutical product to market, a

the product’s safety, efficacy, and quality 
must be submitted to regulatory 
authorities. Depending on the country, this 
process can take months or even years, 
influenced by the efficiency of the 
regulatory body and nature of the product. Furthermore, the negotiation of selling 
prices or reimbursement levels with 
regulators and payers often delays 
availability, while cost-containment 
measures — such as government-imposed 
price reductions and reference pricing 
systems — can further limit access to 
medicines. Failure to tackle these challenges 
collectively risks not only delaying access 
to medicines for patients but also 
impacting public trust, reputation and 
business sustainability. Therefore, a 
holistic effort — focused on patient-
centered solutions, regulatory innovation, 
and shared accountability — is essential to 
bridging the gap between innovation and

we receive during these engagements helps us create 
long-term and sustainable value. We concentrate our outreach efforts on our largest

resent approximately 60% of our ownership. While the 
Board Chair, CEO and CFO, together with Investor Rela-

engagement, other senior managers from within and

Risk management
Our approach
Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
framework is designed to generate a 
holistic view of risks for our company and 
drive a culture of informed risk-taking that 
advances our strategy. Our annual ERM process is based on three 
main steps: understanding and adapting to 
the rapidly changing dynamics of our 
external environment; identifying, 
assessing and analyzing potential risks to 
the success of our strategy; and setting a 
clear risk appetite for each risk and taking 
actions to achieve our target risk exposure. Throughout the year, we hold risk 
workshops with business leaders from 
countries, organizational units and global 
functions. This helps us integrate risk 
management into our activities and better 
understand our risk exposure through

The ERM process continued to evolve in 2024. The Cor-
porate ERC team conducted risk workshops and collab-
orated with all risk assurance and monitoring functions 
to identify key risks across the Company. Each Novartis 
unit organized a focused risk workshop including leader-

Revenue on the sale of Novartis products and services, 
which is recorded as net sales to third parties in the line 
“Net sales from continuing operations” in the consoli-
dated income statement, is recognized when a contrac-
tual promise to a customer (performance obligation) has 
been fulfilled by transferring control over the promised 
goods and services to the customer, substantially all of 
which is at the point in time of shipment to, or receipt of, 
the products by the customer or when the services are 
performed. If contracts contain customer acceptance 
provisions, revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction 
of the acceptance criteria. If a contract contains more 
than one performance obligation, the consideration is 
allocated based on the standalone selling price of each 
performance obligation. The amount of revenue recog-
nized is based on the consideration Novartis expects to 
receive in exchange for its goods and services, when it 
is highly probable",181,,page181_chunk002,0.0062,-11.2562,-7.8775,3,0.0,-7.8775,84,bm25:0.012; tfidf:0.314; dpr:0.087

While we prioritize absolute emission 
reductions, we plan to neutralize any 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions from energy that 
remain in 2025, using a mix of high-quality 
biomethane certificates and nature-based 
carbon removal solutions. Of the emissions associated with our 
business, 95% are generated outside our 
own operations (Scope 3). To address 
these emissions, we have been integrating 
environmental sustainability criteria in 
supply contracts since 2022 and aim to 
complete this for all suppliers in scope by 
2025. We further engage with suppliers to 
support them in reducing their own 
emissions, and are leveraging 
partnerships to drive product and 
process innovation. We systematically integrate life-cycle

Risk management and strategy
Protecting the security and integrity of the IT systems 
under our control and safeguarding the privacy of our 
customers, patients and employees is a top priority for 
us at all levels. Cybersecurity and data privacy risks are 
among the core enterprise risks evaluated through our 
annual enterprise risk management assessment. The Chief Security Officer oversees our cybersecu-
rity risk management program in partnership with our 
Chief Information Officer and other business leaders. The program was developed to assess, identify and man-
age risks from cybersecurity threats and respond to 
cybersecurity breaches and cyberattacks, and to pro-
tect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and con-
tinued availability of information owned by, or in the care
