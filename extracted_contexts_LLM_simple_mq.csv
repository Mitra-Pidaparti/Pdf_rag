- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Parent has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

Reliance operates in dynamic environments. The Company continually assesses issues that are most material to its business and stakeholders and prioritises critical topics that need to be addressed as part of its business activities. Reliance conducted a materiality assessment for the listed entity in FY 2021-22 to identify material issues based on international reporting standards. The assessment also prioritised key internal and external stakeholders with the most impact and influence on Reliance. Relevant stakeholder engagement mechanisms were used to capture the inputs of the identified stakeholders on the potential material issues. Each potential material issue was analysed in detail, taking into account the inputs from stakeholders and management. The material topics were then prioritised based on both management and stakeholder perspectives. ## Materiality Assessment Methodology

## Customer Satisfaction

## Initiatives

The Company ensures that the customer is at the focal point of all decision-making processes related to delivering products, services, and experiences. In line with this belief, Reliance Digital introduced multilingual customer support at its Contact Centre. Representatives can now communicate with customers in 10 different regional languages, ensuring that language is not a barrier to excellent service. Reliance Digital implemented new features on its reoQ app to improve its functionality and convenience for customers who can now purchase and renew the req Care Plan (RCP) directly from the reoQ app, streamlining the process and saving time. The Company promotes the reoQ app through its interactive Voice Response (IVR) and calls with customers, allowing them to easily raise repair and service requests without contacting the Contact Center. The Company also upgraded its WhatsApp Chabot, enabling customers to get answers to most of their queries. To better track and monitor call volumes across all channels, Reliance Digital migrated to the advanced Genepys platform. This has allowed the Company to revarnp its IVR and create multiple call queues to reduce customer wait times, resulting in consistently achieving a 99\% call answered ratio. Reliance has also implemented logic for autossignment of email tickets to resolver groups and of repeat emails leading to a 34\% reduction in complaint ratios compared to the previous year, with $98 \%$ of customer emails being actioned within the specified turn around time.

Impact on: (1) , all businesses

## Risk Description

Our business operations have a vast geographical spread, both onshore as well as offshore. This makes Reliance vulnerable to manmade and natural disasters such as insider threat, social unrest, cyclones etc. These threats may be amplified by divisive use of social media networks. Geopolitical developments too can have a defining impact on business operations. These could cause harm to our assets, people, information and reputation. Even a seemingly minor incident has the potential to snowball and adversely impact our operations and stakeholders. Therefore, having high situational awareness with prompt and commensurate means to effectively respond in a proactive manner, is required to deal with all crises. Risk management and Business continuity plans are critical to ensure that business operations are not disrupted and if compromised, we should have the ability to restore the operations at the earliest. Some of the network locations, offices, employees and other ecosystems are subject to various forms of intentional or natural disruptions, thereby impacting network availability, customer experience, restoration cost and efforts. The growing E-commerce business is vulnerable to specific risks like Customer abuse (fake returns, related account abuse, fake claims - as order not received, empty box, wrong item received etc.), Account compromise, Brand infringement, Phishing/Vishing attacks etc. which are likely to increase manifolds. Of these, customer abuse is probably the most critical of risks. Fraudsters continue to innovate new methods to bypass system checks on Ecom platform/physical processes to defraud. There is thus a need to closely monitor these risks and have a robust mitigation strategy to protect business interests. ## Risk Response

Global Corporate Security (GCS) focuses on adopting dynamic and pre-emptive risk management strategies to safeguard and secure the Company. GCS is responsible for securing people, assets and operations of RIL.

This is accomplished by employing the best global practices and accepted mitigation strategies to minimise the risk exposure.

Reliance recognises the importance of Data privacy and safeguarding personal data is one of the top priorities at Reliance. Data privacy principles are followed across the lifecycle of personal data to address data privacy risks. Reliance ensures all its business processes follow the privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default approach and makes sure that the personal data is used ethically and legally.

RIL has always been at the forefront of using cutting-edge technologies for bringing more efficiency into businesses. Digital transformation is thus an ongoing activity in Reliance.

Cybersecurity risk is thus emerging as one of the prominent business risks. Cybercrime and Cyber Insecurity is considered as one of the severe global risks as per the World Economic Forum's Global Risk Report 2023 making it clear that cyber risks will remain a constant and significant concern over the next decade.

- Obtained Management Representation Letter as regards the fair valuation of these investments. In respect of the key audit matter reported to us by the auditors of R3L, we performed inquiry of the audit procedures performed by them to address the key audit matter. As reported by the subsidiary auditors, the following procedures have been performed by them:

- Evaluated and tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the relevant business process controls, inter-alia controls over the capture, measurement and authorization of revenue transactions, involving internal information Technology (IT) specialists for the automated controls, interface controls and reports generated through various relevant IT systems involved in the revenue process.
- Involved internal IT specialists and tested the IT environment inter-alia for access controls, change management and application specific controls in the IT Systems over the Company's billing and other relevant support systems.
- Tested collections and the reconciliation between revenue per the billing system and the financial records. Performed procedures to test the computation of revenue and deferred revenue. (b) The auditors of Reliance Retail Limited (RRL), a stepdown subsidiary of the Parent, have reported revenue recognition as a key audit matter. RRL is engaged in organized retail and the trading transactions generating revenue comprise of high volume of individually small transactions which increases the risk of revenue being recognised inappropriately and which highlights the criticality of sound internal processes of summarising and recording sales. RRL trades in various consumption baskets on a principal basis and recognises full value of consideration as its revenue. The revenue is recognised on transfer of control of traded goods to the customers. Transfer of control coincides with collection of cash or cash equivalent from customers, in view of the above and since revenue is a key performance indicator for RRL, revenue recognition is identified as a key audit matter.

As a Company that strongly focuses on integrating the key concerns and needs of its stakeholders into its business and sustainability strategy, Reliance has identified double material issues.

Climate Change
Reliance faces several physical and transitional risks related to climate change. Physical risks include climate-related events that can impact the Company's financial stability and value creation capabilities. Transitional risks stem from changes in the energy market as the word progresses towards a more sustainable future and embraces clearer energy forms. Failure to adapt to these changes could lead to decreased profitability and stakeholder value and regulatory penalties. ## $\rightarrow$ PAGE 175

## Managing Environmental Impacts

Effective environmental management is important for Reliance to comply with regulations, avoid legal risks, and maintain a positive reputation. It is, therefore, critical for the Company to assess potential risks associated with its operations and mitigate them by reducing emissions, minimising water use, and preventing waste and pollution. Failure to do so could result in legal action, fines, and reputational damage. Prioritising environmental sustainability demonstrates Reliance's commitment to responsible corporate citizenship, protecting brand reputation and contributing to a more sustainable future.
