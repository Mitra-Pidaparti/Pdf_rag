Issues with pdf_rag:

1) Chunk formation: Based on length only: Uneccessary info will reduce its similarity score
2)Matched Sentence: Only one is retrieved. While in the human output a whole chunk is.
3)Embedding model should be improved
4)Extracting matching sentence from the chunk
5)Other options than cosine similarity



Q> Is efficiency as important?
> Why are more relevant ranked lower in some cases?

>Tested the semantic_chunking: Bit of improvement
>Used larger spacy model
>Used better Sentence Transformer

>Noticeable improvement but following issues:

1. Still irrelevant sections
2. Subsidiary headings not mentioned in matched sentence
3. Suppose a relevant chunk exists with both Vision and Mission mentioned- either only a bit or separately extracted
4. Page Numbers ar all wrong

>Targets today:
1. Look for an LLM integratino solution
2. Solve 3 completely
3. Reduce irrelevant sections
