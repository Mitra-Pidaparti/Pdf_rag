Impact and risk management
Animal research is a necessary element in 
the development of new treatments in 
pre-clinical research to ensure the safety 
of clinical trials. The use of animals in 
research carries the risk of causing 
physical and psychological harm, including 
pain, stress, or suffering, to the animals 
involved. Failure to uphold high welfare 
standards can result in ethical concerns 
and undermine public trust. Main policies
We fully support the replacement of 
animals with alternatives wherever 
feasible, while meeting our obligations to 
patients and the expectations of 
regulatory agencies. Our animal research is governed by our 
Animal Welfare policy, which applies to all 
Novartis-sponsored studies, whether 
internal or external. The policy commits us 
to applying the 3Rs principles — to replace 
animals with other method",45,,page45_chunk001,13.5335,0.0157,0.1959,0.4798,0.3946,-11.0449,-6.4918,0.1,-6.4718,0.0,-6.4718

Novartis in Society  
Integrated Report 2024
In our first full-year as a pure-play 
medicines company, Novartis delivered 
strong results, with double-digit growth 
in sales and net profit in 2024. The 
performance validates our strategy 
and gives us confidence that we are 
well prepared to grow by focusing 
on our key therapeutic areas and 
technology platforms. The strategic shift from a diversified life 
sciences company to a focused medicines 
organization over the last decade has 
proven to be the right path forward. With 
the divestment of our non-core activities 
in animal health, vaccines and generics, 
among others, we were able to free up 
resources and strengthen our position in 
fast-growing and highly innovative medical 
fields such as xRNA, radioligand therapy 
and gene and cell therapy. Our recent breakthroughs in breast 
cancer and kidney and blood diseases 
demonstrate that our operational focus 
strengthens our ability to deliver high-value

3. Other income
The French Competition Authority (FCA) conducted an investigation into Lucentis against several Novartis subsid-
iaries. In 2020, Novartis AG was jointly held liable for a fine of EUR 308 million. As Lucentis is commercialized by 
Novartis subsidiaries, rather than by Novartis AG itself, Novartis AG was fully reimbursed by the operational sub-
sidiary. In 2023, this decision was reformed and the fine of EUR 308 million (CHF 308 million) was reimbursed to 
Novartis AG. As a result, Novartis AG reimbursed the full amount to the operational subsidiary. These amounts are 
shown net in the income statement in 2023. 4. Goodwill
