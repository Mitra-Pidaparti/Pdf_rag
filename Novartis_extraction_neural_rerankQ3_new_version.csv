In our first full-year as a pure-play 
medicines company, Novartis delivered 
strong results, with double-digit growth 
in sales and net profit in 2024. The 
performance validates our strategy 
and gives us confidence that we are 
well prepared to grow by focusing 
on our key therapeutic areas and 
technology platforms. The strategic shift from a diversified life 
sciences company to a focused medicines 
organization over the last decade has 
proven to be the right path forward. With 
the divestment of our non-core activities 
in animal health, vaccines and generics, 
among others, we were able to free up 
resources and strengthen our position in 
fast-growing and highly innovative medical 
fields such as xRNA, radioligand therapy

2024 CEO Annual Incentive balanced scorecard (continued) At the start of the performance cycle, the Board sets the CEO specific targets against each of the four strategic 
objectives listed below. We provide here a summary of those targets that most heavily impact overall performance 
and their respective achievement. 2024 was another strong performance exceeding external (consensus) and internal (targets) expectations. Sales, 
profit and free cash flow growth were strong. The focus on innovative medicines and simplification of our opera-
tions after the organizational restructuring are having a visible impact across the company. The Research and Devel-
opment units performed in line with our plan with targeted project timelines acceleration across R&D, and comple-
mentary BD&L/M&A",76,,page76_chunk003,19.4643,0.0201,0.2325,0.5382,0.4465,-10.0938,-5.9021,0.1,-5.8821,0.5727,-6.5558

complex process of registering and 
distributing medicines globally. To bring a 
pharmaceutical product to market, a 
registration dossier containing evidence of 
the product’s safety, efficacy, and quality 
must be submitted to regulatory 
authorities. Depending on the country, this 
process can take months or even years, 
influenced by the efficiency of the 
regulatory body and nature of the product. Furthermore, the negotiation of selling 
prices or reimbursement levels with 
regulators and payers often delays 
availability, while cost-containment 
measures — such as government-imposed 
price reductions and reference pricing 
systems — can further limit access to 
medicines. Failure to tackle these challenges 
collectively risks not only delaying access 
to medicines for patients but also 
impacting public trust, reputation and 
business sustainability. Therefore, a
