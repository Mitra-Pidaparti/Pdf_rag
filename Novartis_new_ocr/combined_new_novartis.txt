Novartis in Society  
Integrated Report 2024
In our first full-year as a pure-play 
medicines company, Novartis delivered 
strong results, with double-digit growth 
in sales and net profit in 2024. The 
performance validates our strategy 
and gives us confidence that we are 
well prepared to grow by focusing 
on our key therapeutic areas and 
technology platforms.
The strategic shift from a diversified life 
sciences company to a focused medicines 
organization over the last decade has 
proven to be the right path forward. With 
the divestment of our non-core activities 
in animal health, vaccines and generics, 
among others, we were able to free up 
resources and strengthen our position in 
fast-growing and highly innovative medical 
fields such as xRNA, radioligand therapy 
and gene and cell therapy.
Our recent breakthroughs in breast 
cancer and kidney and blood diseases 
demonstrate that our operational focus 
strengthens our ability to deliver high-value 
medicines that alleviate society’s greatest 
disease burdens. As we continue to 
accelerate our research and development 
efforts and strengthen our commercial 
capabilities, we expect to continue to grow 
profitably in the long-term and create 
sustainable shareholder value.
Our efforts to more efficiently align our 
Research, Development and Commercial 
organizations advanced further. Besides 
strategic acquisitions to increase our 
technological capacity and broaden our 
pipeline, we integrated artificial intelligence 
more deeply into our day-to-day operations 
to more efficiently assess new molecules 
and accelerate drug development 
timelines.
In view of continuing geopolitical and 
economic volatility, we are further 
strengthening our global production 
and distribution network to withstand 
potential supply chain disruptions and 
improve overall resilience. We will stay 
disciplined in managing our technical and 
data infrastructure as well as our partner 
networks and build an agile footprint to 
quickly adapt to the changing environment.
Environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) matters remained high on our 
agenda. We deepened our commitment to 
vital topics: improving access to medicines, 
taking further measures in our fight against 
climate change and strengthening our 
ethics framework, among other things. Our 
efforts have been recognized by leading 
independent agencies and are reflected in 
consistently high rankings.
During my 12-year tenure as Chair, my 
priorities were, among others, to focus 
the company on its core pharmaceutical 
expertise, improve its governance, 
appoint strong executive leadership and 
help create a highly versatile Board of 
Directors to navigate the increasingly 
complex healthcare landscape. With Dr. 
Giovanni Caforio, who after shareholder 
approval is scheduled to join the Board as 
Non-Executive Chair in April 2025, Novartis 
has secured an outstanding leader to guide 
the company through its next phase.
I thank you for the confidence you have 
placed in our company and am pleased 
to be able to propose a dividend increase 
of 6% to CHF 3.50 at the next Annual 
General Meeting.
Sincerely,
 
Joerg Reinhardt
Chair of the Board of Directors
Chair’s letter
“	Our recent breakthroughs in breast cancer and kidney and 
blood diseases demonstrate our ability to deliver high-value 
medicines that alleviate society’s greatest disease burdens.”

Novartis in Society  
Integrated Report 2024
2024 was a year of impact at Novartis. 
We reached nearly 300 million patients with 
our innovative therapies — more than ever 
before — as we built on the momentum 
from our successful transformation. We 
consistently delivered strong financial 
and operational performance, significant 
R&D achievements, and sustainable 
growth, and are well positioned to increase 
value for shareholders and society 
moving forward. 
Core to our approach is a relentless 
focus on innovation. It allowed us to 
develop and expand access to new 
treatments in our key therapeutic areas 
and technology platforms.
In oncology, we built on the legacy of our 
work in areas like breast cancer and chronic 
myeloid leukemia with Kisqali and Scemblix, 
medicines developed by researchers in 
Novartis labs — a testament to the strength 
of our R&D engine. We secured our spot as 
a global leader in radioligand therapy (RLT), 
a platform we believe has the potential to 
transform cancer care. Pluvicto, our RLT 
therapy for advanced prostate cancer, 
showed strength in the US and Europe. We 
are exploring new referral pathways and 
investing in RLT manufacturing to broaden 
its global availability.  
Our investments in cutting edge 
techno­logy fueled innovation across 
therapeutic areas. We continue to prioritize 
platforms like RLT and RNA therapeutics, 
and increasingly integrate artificial 
intelligence and data science throughout 
our R&D activities. These tools are helping 
uncover potential ways to accelerate drug 
design and clinical trial processes.  
Through a combination of in-house R&D 
and targeted acquisitions and licensing 
agreements, we now have more than 
30 potential new high-value medicines 
in our pipeline and expect more than 
15 submission-enabling readouts over the 
next two years.   
We remain committed to environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) matters. 
We rank highly among industry peers in 
a range of key ESG ratings, and were 
honored to rank number one in the 2024 
Access to Medicine Index.
Fostering a culture of innovation depends on 
people. We aim to recruit, retain, and cultivate 
the best talent in the world. It’s why we’ve 
rebuilt our organization to meet tomorrow’s 
global healthcare challenges through a 
simpler organization, targeted hiring efforts 
and investments in new facilities to serve 
patients around the world. 
Our approach delivered solid financial 
results. This past year saw double-digit 
growth in net sales and core operating 
income and improved core margins. 
Importantly, we delivered strong total 
shareholder returns for our shareholders 
over recent years. 
Looking ahead, I’m confident we’ll see 
sales growth average at least 5% annually 
over the five years to 2029, and reach 40% 
core operating income margin by 2027.1
We’re proud of our record and excited 
about the future. I want to offer a special 
note of thanks to outgoing Board Chair 
Joerg Reinhardt, who steps down after 
decades of leadership at Novartis. His 
impact will carry forward, and I’m grateful 
for his years of mentorship.
In recent years, we’ve narrowed our focus, 
expanded our reach, and invested in the 
future. The result is a strong portfolio of 
innovative therapies that sets us up for 
sustained growth and finds new ways to 
improve and extend patients’ lives. 
Thank you for making that possible. We look 
forward to continuing our momentum in 2025.
Sincerely,
 
Vas Narasimhan
Chief Executive Officer

Progress in science and technology raises 
the possibility of new types of medicines and 
more efficient drug discovery. At the same time, 
many people struggle to access healthcare, 
while aging populations are putting pressure on 
healthcare systems. On this page, we set out 
key trends shaping our industry.
Operating 
environment
Access to medicines remains 
a challenge
Many people around the world 
struggle to access healthcare 
and medicines. The issue is 
linked to demographic, social 
and economic challenges such 
as aging, poverty and inequality, 
as well as to structural issues 
such as limited healthcare 
infrastructure, shortages of 
trained healthcare workers and 
the cost of healthcare and 
medicines. Improving access 
requires a holistic approach 
that acknowledges these 
complex factors and relies on 
stakeholder collaboration and 
partnerships.
The market for healthcare 
is evolving  
Customer groups have 
increasing influence on 
treatment decisions and 
guidelines, while patients 
continue to become more 
informed stakeholders in their 
healthcare decisions and look 
for solutions to meet their 
changing needs.
 
The policy landscape 
is changing 
Evolving legislation and 
regulations are changing how 
governments pay for medicines. 
In the US, the Inflation Reduction 
Act will impose price controls on 
select drugs in the Medicare 
program. The EU is revising the 
legislative framework for 
medicines with the aim of 
improving access and 
affordability, while China has 
rolled out a volume-­based 
procurement program to reduce 
prices for eligible medicines.
 
AI is poised to reshape 
the industry 
Healthcare systems aim to 
build climate resilience 
Healthcare systems are aiming 
to build climate resilience, with 
45 countries committing to 
net-zero carbon emissions in 
their health systems, according 
to the WHO. At the same time, 
climate change and nature 
loss continue to have adverse 
effects on human health, 
mainly from malnutrition, malaria, 
diarrhea and heat stress, with 
respiratory illnesses also on the 
rise due to air pollution.
Healthcare systems are 
under strain 
Demand for high-quality 
healthcare continues to rise 
Scientific progress is opening 
new paths to treat disease 
Rapid progress in medical 
science is creating opportunities 
for new types of treatments. 
These advances highlight the 
importance of investment in 
R&D, including in next-
generation technologies such 
as radioligand therapies and 
gene and cell therapies. 
Demand for medicines in 
areas such as cancer, 
cardiovascular disease and 
immunology continues to grow 
in key markets. The US and EU 
markets are expanding. China 
is growing rapidly, while 
spending in Japan is forecast 
to remain stable.  
In many countries, healthcare 
systems are under pressure. 
Long-term factors such as 
aging and lifestyle changes 
have led to a significant rise in 
noncommunicable illnesses 
such as cancer, diabetes and 
heart disease. 
 
Across the biopharmaceutical 
industry, we are beginning to 
realize the benefits of new 
technologies such as AI in 
automating processes and 
generating insights that could 
help us design new 
compounds, predict drug 
safety or speed up drug 
discovery. The extent to which 
companies can harness this 
potential will depend on their 
ability to aggregate and 
analyze large volumes of 
anonymized health data.

platforms (radioligand therapy (RLT), 
xRNA, and gene and cell therapy) that will 
play an important role in delivering 
transformative new medicines. 
We focus on priority markets — US, 
Germany, China and Japan — which 
together account for most of the expected 
growth in global healthcare spending over 
the next five years. Although these are our 
priority markets, we maintain a strong 
presence in other markets worldwide.
Strategic priorities
To support our focus areas, we have three 
strategic priorities: 
Deliver high-value medicines to 
accelerate growth
We aim to increase growth, driven by 
continued strong momentum in our 
existing portfolio of medicines — including 
Entresto, Cosentyx, Kisqali, Kesimpta, 
Scemblix, Pluvicto and Leqvio — and key 
upcoming launches. Over the longer term, 
we expect growth will come through 
delivering high-value medicines that 
sustain and replace our existing 
growth drivers. 
Our R&D strategy focuses on an end-to-
end approach, covering research, 
development, and commercialization. We 
concentrate resources on priority 
programs to maximize early-stage 
potential and ensure effective late-stage 
execution. We also focus on life-cycle 
management by enhancing the evidence 
base for key brands. 
We increase our chances of discovering 
new medicines by collaborating with 
outside researchers and biotech 
companies. Our network consists of 
academic and industry alliances working 
on joint research and drug discovery.
Embed operational excellence to 
deliver returns
In an increasingly competitive 
environment, we are simplifying processes 
and reducing costs to become more 
efficient and effective in our decision-
making and to free up resources for 
investment in new medicines. Our goal is 
to continue making attractive returns to 
shareholders while creating value for 
patients, healthcare systems and society. 
Our focus areas
Our priorities
Core therapeutic areas: 
Cardiovascular, renal and 
metabolic; immunology; 
neuroscience; oncology
Technology platforms: 
Chemistry; biotherapeutics; 
radioligand therapy; xRNA 
therapy; gene and cell therapy
Priority markets: 
US; Germany; China; Japan
Accelerate growth
Deliver high-value medicines
Deliver returns
Embed operational excellence
Strengthen foundations
•	 Unleash the power of our people
•	 Scale data science and technology
•	 Build trust with society
Strategy
Focus areas
We focus on four core therapeutic areas 
with strong growth potential and high 
unmet patient needs — cardiovascular, 
renal and metabolic; immunology; 
neuroscience; and oncology. This focus 
enables us to build depth in these 
therapeutic areas, leveraging our 
scientific expertise to find new ways to 
treat and cure disease, intervene earlier in 
disease pathophysiology, and improve 
quality of life for patients. 
We focus our exploratory research work 
on these core therapeutic areas but also 
look beyond them, recognizing that 
cultivating a robust pipeline and remaining 
on the leading edge of scientific 
discovery requires a slightly wider 
aperture in early research. 
We are investing in technology platforms 
that we expect will deliver future high-
value medicines. We focus on two 
established platforms (chemistry and 
biotherapeutics) plus three advanced

In our manufacturing sites, we are 
expanding capacity in strategic focus 
areas such as biopharmaceuticals and 
advanced technology platforms. For 
example, we are investing to expand our 
platform for RLT, a type of precision 
nuclear medicine that requires quick 
delivery to patients, since the activity of 
the radioisotope it contains diminishes 
over time. 
To ensure product quality, we maintain a 
quality management system for our 
medicines in compliance with 
requirements from health authorities and 
other regulators. We are also switching 
more of our production to renewable 
energy and reducing the environmental 
footprint of our sites.
Strengthen our foundations
We continue to invest in the foundations of 
our long-term success. We have made 
progress in strengthening our culture to 
attract and retain talent, while developing 
artificial intelligence capabilities across 
our value chain and continuing to build 
trust with stakeholders and society. 
 
ESG strategy
Our ESG strategy is a fundamental 
component of our purpose to reimagine 
medicine and our strategic imperative 
to build trust with society. This strategy 
is integrated across the company 
to drive long-term sustainable value 
for stakeholders. 
We aim to be a sector leader, with a focus 
on the areas where we can have the most 
impact through our core business: 
innovation to tackle serious diseases and 
making sure our medicines are accessible 
in different health systems. 
Key elements of our ESG strategy
•	 Innovation and access to medicines: 
we are committed to expanding access 
to our medicines globally, working with 
our partners to employ a variety of 
strategies such as value-based pricing, 
patient support programs, and initiatives 
to strengthen healthcare systems.
•	 Human capital: we foster an inclusive 
workplace culture, believing it fuels 
innovation, drives engagement, and 
attracts talent.
•	 Environmental sustainability: recognizing 
the connection between planetary and 
patient health, we strive to minimize our 
environmental impact by working toward 
ambitious targets in climate and nature.
•	 Ethical standards: we uphold high 
ethical standards, effectively manage 
risks, and ensure compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations to meet 
societal expectations.
Our ESG strategy is designed to align with 
our corporate purpose, embedding 
sustainability into our operations and 
decision-making processes to create 
value for both society and the company.

Research and development
The discovery and development of a new 
drug usually requires approximately 10 to 
15 years from initial research to launch. 
Our research and early development 
program is conducted by our Biomedical 
Research unit, which is responsible for the 
discovery of new medicines that bring 
value for patients, healthcare systems and 
the company.  We have 5 582 full-time-­
equivalent scientists, physicians and 
business professionals at Biomedical 
Research sites.
Our Development unit oversees and 
executes drug development activities, 
working collaboratively with Biomedical 
Research, our commercial units and other 
parts of the company on our overall 
pipeline strategy. It has 12 773 full-time-­
equivalent employees worldwide. Our 
development process consists of two 
stages: early development to build 
confidence in the overall properties of the 
compound, followed by confirmatory 
development to confirm the concept in 
large numbers of patients. 
We continue to make significant investments 
to support our R&D strategy. In 2024, our 
core R&D expense from continuing 
operations was USD 9.3 billion, compared 
with USD 8.6 billion in the prior year.
Production
Novartis operates 33 manufacturing sites 
worldwide. Our primary goal is to ensure 
the uninterrupted and timely supply of 
medicines that meet all product 
specifications and quality standards, and 
that are produced in the most cost-
effective and sustainable manner. The 
manufacturing of our products is highly 
regulated by governmental health 
authorities around the world. In addition to 
regulatory requirements, many of our 
products involve technically complex 
manufacturing processes or require highly 
specialized raw materials. 
Regulatory submission
To register a pharmaceutical product, a 
registration dossier containing evidence 
establishing the safety, efficacy and 
quality of the product must be submitted 
to regulatory authorities. If approved, we 
generally have certain exclusive rights to 
market and sell the medicine for a 
defined period.
Marketing and sales
Novartis sells products in approximately 
120 countries worldwide. Although 
specific distribution patterns vary by 
country, Novartis sells its prescription 
drugs primarily to drug wholesalers, 
retailers, private health systems, 
government agencies, managed care 
providers, pharmacy benefit managers 
and government-supported healthcare 
systems. We reach healthcare 
professionals and patients in many 
markets and across our core therapeutic 
areas through integrated channels 
including field-force operations, patient 
support programs and Novartis-owned 
digital platforms. Novartis also pursues 
co-promotion or co-marketing 
opportunities as well as licensing and 
distribution agreements with other 
companies in various markets.
We have 19 135 full-time-equivalent 
field-force employees, as of December 31, 
2024, including supervisors and 
administrative personnel. These trained 
representatives present the 
therapeutic benefits and risks of our 
products to physicians, pharmacists, 
hospitals, insurance groups, managed 
care organizations and other 
healthcare professionals.
Upstream: supply chain
Novartis works with thousands of 
business partners. To reduce supply risk, 
we maintain multiple sources for key 
inputs and raw materials. We require our 
partners to comply with applicable laws 
and regulations, as well as Novartis 
standards, including those for quality, 
ethics, environmental sustainability and 
human rights.
Downstream: healthcare 
systems and patients
Our medicines are prescribed for use in 
patients by physicians or other healthcare 
professionals. In 2024, Novartis medicines 
reached 296 million patients worldwide.

Material topics
Understanding of our material topics is also 
based on ongoing engagement with 
external stakeholders; our enterprise risk 
management process; social, economic 
and environmental (SEE) impact valuation 
analysis; and other sources. We are also 
conducting a detailed analysis of impacts, 
risks, and opportunities (IROs) that will 
inform our reporting obligations under EU 
law from 2025 onwards.
We continually review trends 
and changes in our operating 
environment and business model to 
identify and assess the relevance 
of our most material topics — those 
where we have the most impact on 
people and the environment and 
that could have the most significant 
potential impact on our business.  
Results from this assessment inform both 
our strategy and our approach to 
reporting. The assessment complements 
our annual risk analysis (see page 53).
Our most recent materiality assessment, 
conducted in 2021, reflects the input of 
more than 500 external and 12 000 
internal stakeholders. Respondents were 
asked to estimate the impact of Novartis 
on eight separate topic areas. The chart 
opposite shows the results. 
External stakeholders were drawn from 
our main stakeholder groups, including 
patients, customers, partners and 
shareholders. Internal stakeholders were 
drawn from senior management, as well as 
units and functions.

We believe our 2021 materiality 
assessment continues to reflect our most 
material topics. However, we continue to 
adjust and prioritize our disclosures to 
reflect the insights gained from our 
stakeholders, such as the increased 
importance of environmental matters. 
Stakeholder engagement
Novartis works with stakeholders — 
in­cluding patients, healthcare professionals, 
employees, investors, suppliers and 
regulators — to understand their needs and 
expectations and to pursue common 
goals. The table on page 17 shows an 
overview of our key stakeholders and how 
we engage with them.

Innovation performance
Cardiovascular, renal and 
metabolic
In our renal portfolio, we are making 
progress in advancing new therapeutic 
options for rare kidney diseases, which 
may preserve kidney function and help 
people live longer without the need for 
dialysis or transplantation. 
We received accelerated US approval for 
Fabhalta (iptacopan) to treat adults with 
immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), a 
disease in which the immune system 
attacks the kidneys, often causing 
inflammation and proteinuria (high levels 
of protein in urine). The approval was 
based on the interim analysis of a Phase 
III study that showed a reduction in 
proteinuria compared with placebo. 
Fabhalta is the first of our renal pipeline to 
receive FDA approval. In 2024, we also 
submitted atrasentan, which has a different 
mechanism of action to Fabhalta, for 
approval in the US based on the interim 
results of a Phase III study that showed a 
reduction in proteinuria compared with 
placebo for patients with IgAN.
We also filed regulatory submissions in 
the EU, China, Japan and the US for 
Fabhalta to treat adult patients with C3 
glomerulopathy, another rare kidney 
disease that initially presents in mostly 
children and young adults and currently 
has no approved treatment options. The 
submissions followed positive results from 
a Phase III trial in adult patients. 
Enrollment is ongoing in a separate 
cohort of adolescent patients with C3G.
Fabhalta, which was discovered and 
developed by Novartis, has the potential 
to treat multiple diseases, within the renal 
space and across broader therapeutic 
areas. In 2024, we also received 
regulatory approval for Fabhalta in the EU 
and Japan to treat paroxysmal nocturnal 
hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare and serious 
blood disorder, building on the US 
approval for PNH in the previous year.
In our cardiovascular portfolio, we 
announced positive topline results from 
a Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy 
of Leqvio (inclisiran) as monotherapy in 
patients at low or moderate risk of 
developing atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who are 
not receiving lipid-lowering therapy. The 
trial adds to the growing body of 
evidence for Leqvio across the full 
spectrum of ASCVD as we strive to help 
more patients in need. Leqvio is 
registered in more than 105 countries 
and commercially available in 78. 
Immunology
We announced data from two pivotal 
Phase III studies of remibrutinib to treat 
patients with chronic spontaneous 
urticaria (CSU), which showed significant 
improvements in patients who remained 
symptomatic despite H1-antihistamine 
use. CSU, also known as chronic hives, is 
an immunological disease, characterized 
by the sudden appearance of itchy hives 
and/or deep tissue swelling, that can 
severely impact quality of life.  
We plan to submit remibrutinib for 
regulatory approval in the US and Europe 
in 2025. If approved, it has the potential to 
become the first of a new class of CSU 
treatment in a decade, offering an effective 
treatment option for the 60% of patients 
uncontrolled by H1-antihistamines.
Neuroscience
We announced data that continue to 
support the clinical benefit of OAV101 IT 
(onasemnogene abeparvovec) to treat 
spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare, 
genetic neuromuscular disease and a 
leading genetic cause of infant death. The 
primary objective of the Phase III study 
was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
OAV101 IT in patients with SMA aged 2-18. 
Many patients with SMA currently rely on 
chronic treatments to manage their 
disease. These positive topline results 
from the STEER trial underscore the 
efficacy, safety and tolerability of OAV101 
IT in patients with SMA aged two and 
above. 
Oncology
We received approval in the US and 
Europe for Kisqali (ribociclib) for use with 
an aromatase inhibitor to treat people 
with HR+/HER2- stage II and III early 
breast cancer who are at high risk of 
recurrence. This decision was based on 
the Phase III NATALEE trial, which 
showed that Kisqali reduces the risk of 
the cancer coming back by 25% 
compared with hormone therapy alone. 
This approval means that more patients, 
including those without lymph node 
involvement, can now benefit from this 
treatment.
In addition, we received accelerated 
approval in the US for Scemblix 
(asciminib) to treat adult patients with 
newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive chronic myeloid 
leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP). 
The expanded indication in Ph+ CML-CP, 
which now includes newly diagnosed and 
previously treated adults, increases the 
population eligible for Scemblix by

approximately four times. Scemblix is 
under regulatory review in this indication 
in key international markets worldwide, 
including in China and Japan.
During the year, we submitted our 
radioligand therapy (RLT) Pluvicto 
(lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan) for 
approval in the US to treat patients with a 
type of advanced prostate cancer called 
PSMA-positive metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer in the pre-
chemotherapy setting, underscoring the 
opportunity to expand the promise of 
Pluvicto to help more patients with 
prostate cancer. 
Also in our RLT portfolio, we received 
approval in the US for Lutathera (lutetium 
Lu 177 dotatate) to treat pediatric 
patients 12 years and older with 
somatostatin receptor-positive (SSTR+) 
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumors (GEP-NETs). This approval makes 
Lutathera the first therapy specifically 
approved for use in pediatric patients 
with GEP-NETs, which are rare tumors 
found in the digestive tract.
Novartis is investigating a broad portfolio 
of RLTs, exploring new isotopes, ligands 
and combination therapies to look 
beyond GEP-NETs and prostate cancer 
and into breast, colon, lung and 
pancreatic cancer.
Global health
We continue to advance potential new 
medicines for global health challenges 
such as malaria and leishmaniasis.
In 2024, we launched a Phase III clinical 
trial for ganaplacide/ lumefantrine 
(KLU156) for the treatment of patients 
with acute uncomplicated malaria. 
Ganaplacide/ lumefantrine is being 
developed in partnership with the 
WANECAM2 (West African Network for 
Clinical Trials of Antimalarial drugs) 
Consortium as well as the Medicines for 
Malaria Venture and their partners. 
In partnership with the Drugs for 
Neglected Diseases Initiative, we are also 
conducting Phase II studies of LXE408, a 
potential oral treatment for visceral 
leishmaniasis. We expanded the trial to 
Ethiopia in 2024 after launching in India 
in 2023.
Operational 
performance
Novartis operates 33 manufacturing sites 
worldwide. As we execute our focused 
business strategy, we are expanding 
manufacturing capacity in key growth 
areas such as biopharmaceuticals and 
advanced technology platforms. 
In 2024, we announced the construction 
of two new radioligand therapy (RLT) 
manufacturing facilities in the US to 
support growing demand for our RLT 
medicines. We broke ground on a new 
facility at our Indianapolis site for 
producing radioisotopes critical for RLT 
and we are establishing a new RLT 
manufacturing site – our third in the US 
– in Carlsbad, California. 
The new facilities represent our 
continued investment in developing a 
robust infrastructure to support the 
expanding use of RLTs to treat cancer. 
These facilities will be built with room for 
further expansion to enable the potential 
production of different isotopes, ligands 
and RLTs. Once completed and 
approved, they will further strengthen the 
Novartis RLT manufacturing and global 
supply network. 
Alongside our investments in RLT, we 
continued to advance our capabilities 
across our other strategic platforms, 
including increasing our cell culture 
manufacturing capacity in Austria and 
Singapore, and establishing a second 
viral vector facility and biological drug 
substance manufacturing using 
mammalian cell culture at our Menges 
site in Slovenia. We also started routine 
production of large-scale quantities of 
siRNA at our Schweizerhalle facility in 
Switzerland.
Data science and digital 
technology
We are investing to build a strong data, 
digital and IT foundation for our company. 
As part of our overall strategy, we focus 
on priority projects that can be scaled 
globally and have the highest impact. 
One focus area is implementing artificial 
intelligence (AI) use cases across our 
business. For example, through our 
strategic research collaboration with 
Isomorphic Labs, we have developed an 
AI model predicting protein folding to 
reshape drug design. We are also 
exploring how AI can automate parts of 
clinical trial report writing.
As part of our AI strategy, we are 
empowering employees to leverage 
AI-powered tools effectively and securely 
to enhance productivity and decision-
making. In 2024, we launched an 
enterprise-wide AI upskilling campaign 
for employees, which includes 
supporting the adoption of Microsoft 
Copilot. We also established a ‘Data 
Science Academy’ for data scientists and 
other employees.

Sustainability matters
Corporate governance, risk 
management and compensation
Our environmental sustainability strategy 
has three priorities:
•	 Planet: Achieve climate and nature 
targets, including net-zero greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions by 2040
•	 Patients: Develop sustainable products 
for patients, applying sustainable 
design principles for new products
•	 People and policy: Transform the 
sustainability mindset across our 
organization and collaborate with 
industry partners to influence change in 
our sector
Oversight of our environmental 
sustainability strategy, including climate 
and nature topics, ultimately lies with our 
Board of Directors. The Board has delegated 
certain duties and responsibilities to some 
of its committees, who report back to the 
full Board on their activities and findings.
At management level, the Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO) is responsible for 
implementing the environmental sustain­
ability strategy. The CEO chairs the ESG 
Committee, a management committee on 
all ESG matters, that reviews the company’s 
ESG performance and strategy. 
Performance against ESG-related targets, 
including those on climate and nature, is 
integrated in the Executive Committee’s 
compensation system as one of four 
equally weighed strategic objectives that 
account for 40% of the 2024 Annual 
Incentive. For further information on 
corporate governance, see page 48.
Climate
Impact and risk management
Climate change affects the planet and 
human health while presenting various 
risks and opportunities for our business. 
We have incorporated the recommendations 
of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to 
strengthen climate governance, strategy 
and risk management processes, and to 
measure progress with relevant metrics 
and targets that align with our approach.1 
Climate change has triggered, and may 
continue to trigger, the adoption of new 
regulatory requirements across the globe, 
as well as rapidly evolving societal 
expectations. Consistent with the goal of 
the Paris Agreement to limit the global 
temperature increase to 1.5˚C compared 
with pre-industrial levels, we aim to mitigate 
our contribution to climate change. Failing 
to meet our commitments or societal 
expectations for climate mitigation could 
affect our reputation, recruitment, retention, 
operations, financial results and share 
price. We have a transition plan to become 
net zero by 2040 that will require 
significant operating and capital 
expenditures to implement.  
Climate change may also require adap­
tations to our business. Increased heat 
and changes in air pollution may lead to 
changes in disease risk factors, resulting 
in both risks and opportunities for our 
portfolio depending on disease and 
geography, among other factors. 
As many of our products are produced 
using technically complex manufacturing 
processes and require a supply of highly 
specialized raw materials, there is a risk of 
failures in the production and supply of 
critical raw materials. These risks are 
exacerbated by chronic (e.g., water and 
heat stress) and acute (e.g., cyclones, 
flooding, or drought) physical risks that 
can impact assets and activities along our 
value chain, with the potential for supply 
disruptions.
For more information see “Material topics” 
(page 16) and our Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) risk factors on 
“Environmental, social and governance 
matters” (page 54), “Manufacturing and 
product quality” (page 55), and “Supply 
chain” (page 55).
Climate change mitigation
Main policies 
We aim to reduce our environmental 
footprint to mitigate our impacts and 
become a net-zero company by 2040. Our 
near- and long-term ambitions have been 
approved by the Science Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi) (see page 28). We have 
established a transition plan to achieve 
our near- and long-term targets. We 
measure progress using changes in 
climate-related indicators such as 
Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.2, 3
To meet our near-term target, we are 
committed to using 100% renewable 
electricity across our operations by 2025, 
following RE100 principles.3 Further, we are 
reducing energy demand through efficiency 
initiatives and process innovations, and 
implementing green technologies across 
our operating sites. We are transitioning 
our fleet to electric vehicles4 by 2030, in 
line with our EV100 commitment.

While we prioritize absolute emission 
reductions, we plan to neutralize any 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions from energy that 
remain in 2025, using a mix of high-quality 
biomethane certificates and nature-based 
carbon removal solutions.
Of the emissions associated with our 
business, 95% are generated outside our 
own operations (Scope 3). To address 
these emissions, we have been integrating 
environmental sustainability criteria in 
supply contracts since 2022 and aim to 
complete this for all suppliers in scope by 
2025. We further engage with suppliers to 
support them in reducing their own 
emissions, and are leveraging 
partnerships to drive product and 
process innovation.
We systematically integrate life-cycle 
assessment (LCA) methods in our R&D 
pipeline to calculate and improve the 
environmental impact of our products. 
We have implemented measures to reduce 
waste and emissions resulting from our 
clinical trials, and have obtained My 
Green Lab certification for 96% of our 
laboratories in technical R&D.
To accelerate progress across the 
pharmaceutical sector and other 
industries, we work closely with 
organizations that share our ambition to 
reduce the effects of climate change and 
nature loss, such as the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD), the Sustainable Markets Initiative 
(SMI), the Pharmaceutical Environmental 
Group (PEG), and the Pharmaceutical 
Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI). 
We apply a shadow carbon price of USD 
100/tCO2e in decisions on strategic capital 
expenditure over USD 20 million. This price 
is reviewed annually. We further factor 
climate change risks and opportunities into 
our financial planning by means of 
Notes:
Progress for our 2025 target is measured against a 2016 base year, while 2022 is the base year for our 2030 and 2040 targets. 
We will invest in biomethane certificates and nature-based carbon removal offsets in 2025 and beyond to achieve our carbon neutrality target.

budgeting to achieve our climate targets 
(see tables opposite). 
We estimate the planned investment 
needed for implementing our net-zero 
transition plan based on three time 
horizons: medium term (up to 2030), 
aligned with our near-term target; long 
term (up to 2040), transitioning to net zero 
across our value chain; and maintaining 
net zero up to 2050, in line with the Paris 
Agreement. 
To reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 
90% from a 2022 base year by 2030, we 
rely on green transport, energy efficiency 
initiatives, scaling up renewable electricity 
and thermal solutions, and operational 
improvements. To reduce Scope 3 
emissions, we rely on supplier engage­
ment, sustainable product design, low-
carbon procurement, and mitigation 
measures across the value chain. Our 
initial assessment indicates a substantive 
increase in operating expenditure until 
2030, supported by targeted capital 
investment projects. 
We assess the resilience of our strategy 
annually through quantitative and 
qualitative climate scenario analysis. 
Where applicable, we use climate 
scenarios that reflect low-, medium-, and 
high-emission pathways. Results from our 
2024 scenario analysis show a potentially 
significant risk exposure from carbon 
pricing in the short, medium and long 
term. Carbon prices can affect Novartis 
as a direct charge on Scope 1 emissions 
or indirectly as higher overall costs 
passed through from suppliers.1
At the same time, prices for electricity 
generated from renewable energy are 
lower than those from fossil-fuel energy, 
presenting an opportunity from potentially 
lower operating costs through lower 
market prices, cheaper Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPAs) or on-site renewable 
energy generation.
We can significantly reduce our exposure 
by implementing our climate transition 
plan. Considering recent progress, we 
have no reason to believe that we will not 
achieve our near- and long-term absolute 
emission reduction targets. The table 
opposite provides an overview of the 
anticipated financial effects. 
We identified climate litigation as 
potentially significant in the long term. 
Climate change lawsuits can have 
negative effects on enterprise valuation. 
While there is a lack of evidence to date 
linking companies outside of high-emitting 
sectors to climate-related litigation, it is 
possible that companies in lower-emitting 
sectors will fall under the same scrutiny in 
the future. 
Main activities in 2024
In 2024, we continued our progress 
against our net-zero transition plan 
(see page 26). We deployed capital 
expenditure of USD 40 million 
on environmental projects to improve 
energy efficiency, adopt renewable energy 
solutions across our operations, and 
reduce consumption of natural resources. 
Our activities led to a reduction of our own 
emissions and those from purchased 
energy (Scope 1 and 2) by 20% from the 
prior year and 71% from a 2016 base year.
In line with our SBTi-approved target 
boundary, we have reduced our Scope 1 
emissions by 22% and our Scope 2 
emissions by 72% from a 2022 base year.
In 2024, 96% of our purchased electricity 
consumption was renewable, compared 
with 92% a year earlier, after sourcing 
renewable electricity for sites in several 
countries in Asia and South America, 
which are not included in the scope of our 
virtual power purchase agreements in

Europe and North America. We use 100% 
renewable electricity in North America (US 
and Canada) and Europe through our 
virtual power purchase agreements.
To address our Scope 3 emissions, we 
have embedded environmental 
sustainability into our core procurement 
processes and established the related 
governance. Contracts that include 
environmental sustainability criteria now 
cover 76% of Scope 3 emissions, which 
represents an increase of 19 ppts versus 
the previous year. 
Our sourcing practices have also 
evolved to reflect environmental 
sustainability criteria consistently, and 
they are now a standard requirement in 
supplier selection. 
We also continued to engage our suppliers 
to participate in Energize, an industry 
initiative by major pharmaceutical 
companies, aimed at enhancing capability 
and facilitating market access for 
renewable electricity procurement.1 
In addition, we are participating in the

guidance to our suppliers on transitioning 
to sustainable business models. The 
playbook has been shared with more than 
1 000 suppliers and integrated into the 
Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative’s 
(PSCI) standard supplier learning plans.
We engage with key suppliers on their 
carbon footprint that contribute 
significantly to our Scope 3 emissions. We 
have so far onboarded and engaged with 
suppliers covering more than two-thirds 
of Scope 3 emissions.
In 2024, our total Scope 3 emissions 
decreased by 5% from the prior year (13% 
compared with the 2022 baseline).1 The 
calculation of the purchased goods and 
services and capital goods categories, 
which account for 85% of total Scope 3 
emissions, is still largely based on proxy 
data (spend) and statistical modelling 
through the Environmentally Extended 
Input Output model. The share of emission 
factors sourced from suppliers has 
increased to 33%.
Climate change adaptation
Main policies 
Our approach to climate change 
adaptation involves assessing the evolving 
challenges posed by climate-related 
shifts in disease patterns and their 
potential implications for our portfolio and 
sales. Additionally, we evaluate the 
potential financial impacts of physical 
climate risks on our assets, inventories, 
operations and supply chain, including 
risks of potential supply disruption that 
may result in lost revenue. 
Shifts in temperature and air pollution 
affect disease patterns. This is likely to 
influence the prevalence and severity of 
certain health conditions, in particular 
cardiovascular diseases, respiratory 
conditions, kidney diseases, lung cancer, 
and communicable diseases such as 
malaria and dengue.
To understand the potential financial 
impact of these trends on our business, 
we have modelled the change in the 
disease burden of health conditions due to 
climate change as a proxy for changes in 
demand and hence in sales across three 
time horizons — 2030, 2040 and 2050. 
We used scenarios from the Institute of 
Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) 
on trends for climate-related, disease-
specific, disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) from 2023 to 2050, together with 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) intermediate and very low 
GHG emissions scenarios.2 
Across all time horizons, on average we 
see a potential sales decrease for 
medicines used to treat ischemic heart 
disease and asthma due to expected 
declines in pollution levels. For lung cancer, 
results vary by region, with a potential 
decrease in sales driven by particulate 
matter levels in the US and Europe, and an 
increase in the regions Asia, Africa and 
Australasia, and Canada and Latin America.
Meanwhile, across all regions, a potential 
increase in sales driven by climate-related 
factors could occur for renal diseases. 
This effect is expected to be most 
pronounced in Asia, Africa and Australasia, 
with a potential increase in sales of 2.7% 
to 2.8% per USD million in sales by 2050. 
Climate-related events can also threaten 
the uninterrupted and timely supply of 
medicines that meet all product 
specifications and quality standards.
We have established policies and 
processes to support the quality and 
resilience of our supply chain and 
manufacturing processes. For instance, 
we have mitigated physical risks to our 
sites by putting in place infrastructure 
(e.g., shelters, flood defenses), supported 
by administrative procedures (e.g., 
business continuity plans). Further, we 
have an active energy management 
system to optimize energy consumption 
based on site-specific requirements.
As for our supply chain, its broad 
geographic footprint, dual supply for key 
products, and inventory level and stock 
policies make it resilient. In addition, 
suppliers are being required to follow 
environmental sustainability criteria that 
include the implementation of action plans 
with mechanisms to monitor and report on 
progress, mitigate risks and remediate 
failures. 
To further assess the resilience of our 
operations and supply chain to changes in 
physical climate events, we conduct 
annual climate-related scenario analyses. 
In 2024, we assessed all Novartis 
operating sites and warehouse inventories 
for vulnerability to 18 physical climate-
related hazards across three time 
horizons (see table above).3 We used 
climate metric projections under three 
different IPCC socio-economic pathway 
(SSP) emissions scenarios that reflect 
low-, intermediate-, and very high-
emission pathways.4
Two chronic (water and heat stress) and 
three acute (cyclones, flooding, and 
drought) physical risks were shortlisted for 
financial impact analysis, which focused 
1	 In line with SBTi target boundary
2	 SSP2-4.5 (corresponding to an increase in global surface temperature of 2.1°C–3.5° by 2100) and SSP1-1.9 (1°C–1.8°C increase)
3	 Including changing temperature (air, freshwater, marine water), heat stress, temperature variability, permafrost thawing, heatwave, cold wave, wildfire, changing wind patterns, cyclones, storms, changing precipitation patterns (rain), changing precipitation patterns (hail), 
precipitation or hydrological variability, sea level rise, water stress, drought, heavy precipitation, and flooding (coastal, fluvial, pluvial, groundwater)
4	 Low emission pathway (SSP1-2.6): Emissions stay below 2.0°C warming relative to 1850–1900 (median) with implied net zero CO2 emissions in the second half of the century; Intermediate emissions pathway (SSP2-4.5): Scenario approximately in line with the upper end of 
aggregate Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) emission levels by 2030; Very high emissions pathway (SSP5-8.5): A high-reference scenario with no additional climate policy. CO2 emissions roughly double from current levels by 2050

on sites with high or very high exposure to 
these risks by 2050 in an SSP5-8.5 
emissions scenario. We modeled these to 
assess potential financial effects on 
assets (property, plant and equipment 
(PPE) and inventories), net revenue, and 
operating cost (see page 65). 
For acute physical risks, we assessed the 
proportion of assets at significant physical 
climate risk over the short, medium, and 
long term before considering climate 
change adaptation actions by applying 
wind-related and flood-related damage 
functions to sites (see table above). We 
found the highest exposure to flooding at 
our manufacturing sites in Bangladesh, 
Belgium, Italy and Switzerland; at our 
office sites in Argentina, Bangladesh, 
Canada, France and Japan; and at an R&D 
site in the US.
To assess potential revenue at risk from 
effects of physical climate risk, we used 
site-level revenue estimates and downtime 
assumptions tailored to each risk.1 We 
found USD 40.8-59.8 million of our 
revenue to be exposed in 2025, rising to 
USD 188.6-228.3 million by 2050. 
However, with climate adaptation actions, 
we anticipate the actual revenue at risk to 
be considerably lower. 
The analysis of our upstream value chain 
focused on assessing the current 
economic exposure levels to physical risk 
events.2 We found that 427 first-tier 
suppliers, representing 9% of our total 
third-party spend, are exposed to 
significant climate risk, including 12 with 
very high risk. In total, we found suppliers 
representing USD 119 million of revenue to 
be at risk.3
Main activities in 2024
Our actions to ensure the resilience of our 
own sites and supply chain are regularly 
monitored through our enterprise risk 
management (ERM) processes. We 
capture impacts from climate-related and 
other environmental events through our 
health, safety, and environment (HSE) 
processes. In 2024, we did not experience 
any significant climate-related events.
To mitigate the exposure of our own sites 
to physical risks, we are implementing 
initiatives across our operations such as 
optimizing heating, ventilation and air 
conditioning, and upgrading to energy-
efficient equipment and improved 
building insulation.
To initiate site-specific action and 
strengthen business continuity plans, the 
detailed results of our climate-risk analysis 
(see page 65) across our operating sites 
were cascaded into our business 
operations. The results of our supply chain 
analysis were further cascaded to the 
relevant procurement and business 
continuity management teams.
Nature
Impact and risk management
The unsustainable use of natural 
resources can have negative long-term 
impacts on nature and society, and carries 
with it regulatory and reputational risk. 
While climate issues are better 
understood, with widely accepted 
approaches for action, those for nature 
are forming and evolving quickly. 
We have begun assessing and evaluating 
nature-related risks and opportunities in 
our operations and upstream supply chain 
using the LEAP approach (Locate, 
Evaluate, Assess and Prepare) developed 
by the Taskforce on Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures (TNFD). We are 
assessing the role of biodiversity to 
complement water and waste as nature-
related pillars of our environmental 
sustainability strategy as our 
understanding of impacts, risk and 
dependencies matures.
Main policies
We set minimum, mandatory requirements 
for the management of water, waste, 
wastewater and pharmaceuticals in the 
environment. Each part of the organization

Corporate governance, risk 
management and compensation
is required to protect the environment by 
reducing risk; to ensure individuals are 
appropriately skilled, competent and fit for 
performing their tasks properly; and to 
comply with environmental regulation.
We seek to minimize discharge of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into 
water systems, and do not dispose of 
waste containing APIs in landfill.
We regularly measure water and air quality 
to make sure we remain within limits 
permitted by applicable local regulation. 
Sites with established regulatory limits, 
conditions or specific limitations on 
discharges are responsible for collecting 
data on a periodic basis.
Sites also perform an annual self-
assessment of their controls, and the 
assessments of a representative sample 
of sites are tested by an independent 
governance team each year. Conformance 
reviews and legal compliance audits are 
conducted at least every five years. 
Water
We have a target to reduce water 
consumption1 in our own operations by half 
by 2025, compared with our 2016 baseline. 
Other water targets include having no water 
quality impacts from manufacturing 
effluents2 from our own manufacturing sites 
and key API suppliers by 2025. This target 
has been complemented by a target for 
2030 that also includes own labs and all 
API suppliers. 
By 2030, we plan to implement water use 
reductions for own and supplier sites 
based in water stressed basins that have 
potential material impacts on these basins. 
We will set site-specific targets for both 
our own and supplier sites in these areas. 
Sites are identified through our nature 
assessment, which follows the TNFD 
framework and guidance by the Science 
Based Targets Network (SBTN). 
Waste
We have a target to reduce the amount of 
waste sent for disposal by half by 2025, 
compared with a 2016 baseline. To further 
reduce our impact, we have set a new 
target to reduce the amount of waste sent 
for disposal by 30% by 2030, compared 
with a more recent 2022 baseline.
Further, we aim to eliminate polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC), a long-lasting plastic, in 
secondary and tertiary packaging at 
Novartis sites by 2025.
Main activities in 2024
Water
In 2024, we reduced our water 
consumption3 by 9% from the prior year, 
bringing the reduction to 57% since 2016. 
With this we have met, and seek to 
maintain, our 2025 target. In 2024, we 
continued to reduce consumption by using 
more recycled water (where local 
regulations allow) and adopting less 
water-intensive production techniques. 
As of the end of 2024, 97% of Novartis 
manufacturing sites can demonstrate that 
they meet internal water quality 
standards.4
Further, we increased engagement with 
our manufacturing suppliers around their 
maturity in managing their impact on 
aquatic environments, particularly 
concerning effluents containing active 
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). As a 
result, 100% of our high-risk suppliers met 
our water quality standards in 2024, 
compared with 88% in 2023. These 
assessments are conducted in alignment 
with the framework to tackle antimicrobial 
resistance (AMR) laid out by the AMR 
Industry Alliance.
We have developed a plan to expand 
internal water quality standards to Novartis 
R&D locations and all API suppliers in scope. 
Waste
In 2024, we reduced the amount of waste 
sent for disposal by 17% from the prior 
year, bringing the reduction to 72% since 
2016. With this we have met, and seek to 
maintain, our 2025 target. Further, we 
reduced the amount of waste sent for 
disposal by 23% since 2022 (our baseline 
for 2030 targets). 
As part of our continued commitment to 
waste reduction and the use of recycled 
materials, in 2024 we improved process 
efficiencies and used more recycled 
plastics and reusable shipping boxes.
By the end of 2024, we had eliminated 
100% of PVC in packaging compared with 
2016. Our 2025 target is applicable for 24 
manufacturing sites handling final product 
packaging, all of which have already 
eliminated PVC in secondary and tertiary 
product packaging.
We have established a baseline for 
reducing plastics in packaging and 
devices and have continued to remove 
single-use plastics in workplaces.
Biodiversity
In 2024, we conducted a nature 
assessment for own operations and 
upstream supply chain, aligned with the 
TNFD LEAP approach. In 2025, we will 
conduct further analysis to understand the 
impact on Novartis, the environment and 
society, including an assessment of 
1	 Target water consumption includes water discharged via treatment and water lost through evaporation or other destinations
2	 Includes all manufacturing sites within the Novartis network and high-risk suppliers of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including drug substance and drug product. Scope is aligned with the scope of ESO (External Supply Operations) Vendor Segmentation Process and 
includes strategic (long-term relationship) and selected tactical (key technology provider) ESO suppliers. In addition, high-risk suppliers also include antibiotic suppliers
3	 2023 and 2022 water consumption data was updated after the prior year reporting date due to a revised estimate from the Sandoz/ Novartis split for manufacturing operations in Austria after segregated meter reading data was available
4	 Assessment based on water maturity ladder for internal/external suppliers with Level 1: training, legal compliance; Level 2: quantification and risk assessment; and Level 3 (PEC/PNEC<1); PEC: Predicted Environmental Concentrations, PNEC: Predicted No Impact 
Concentrations

downstream value chain impacts. In 
parallel, we are working with industry 
peers and WBCSD on an industry-specific 
roadmap on nature.
Potential material impacts from our own 
operations and upstream supply chain 
include those related to climate, water and 
raw material use. 
The impact from our own operations is 
driven by GHG emissions, water use and 
water quality. The impact in our upstream 
supply chain is mainly driven by GHG 
emissions, water use, water quality and 
land use from raw materials.
All but raw material use are covered by our 
existing environmental sustainability 
strategy. We therefore aim to implement a 
sustainable sourcing program, starting 
with a pilot in 2025. In parallel, we are 
conducting nature assessments at priority 
sites close to nature-sensitive areas. 
Where material, we will establish site-
specific nature management plans.

People and culture 
Impact and risk management
To execute our strategy, we need to 
attract, develop and retain the most 
qualified people at all levels and in all 
functions. If we are unable to do so, our 
ability to achieve our business objectives 
may be affected. In addition, our brand and 
reputation could be negatively impacted, 
and the sense of belonging of our 
workforce may decline.
Equally, as a global employer we have a 
significant impact on people, both within 
our organization and our upstream and 
downstream value chain. Our business 
generates employment with fair working 
conditions, and we provide extensive 
­training and development opportunities 
and contribute to the wellbeing of our 
workforce. Meanwhile, investing in 
fostering belonging and a sense of well-
being promotes innovation and better 
understanding of the unique and varied 
perspectives of customers, patients and 
other stakeholders.
Our efforts in these areas are essential for 
our ability to identify, attract, develop and 
retain a highly skilled workforce. In 
addition, occupational health and safety 
incidents can occur, resulting in negative 
impacts on the workforce in our operations 
or our value chain.
Main policies
Talent management
Guided by global principles, we seek to 
create a fair and inclusive work 
environment by building an inspired, 
curious and unbossed culture (see page 10). 
Our People & Organization Commitment 
Statement supports our commitment to 
fair and respectful treatment of employees 
and to their development and growth. It 
also outlines how we support our overall 
commitment to uphold human rights for 
employees, to treat them with dignity and 
respect, and to provide equal 
opportunities.
We measure employee engagement every 
quarter through a voluntary and 
anonymous survey. It is sent to all 
employees and carried out by an external 
vendor to ensure independence.
Aggregated results are used to identify 
potential risks and make improvements to 
working conditions, training and 
development, access to support programs 
and other areas where necessary.
Training and development 
We recognize that preparing for the future 
requires a workforce with a depth and 
breadth of skills. That is why we invest in 
the development of our people for current 
and future skills, offering access to 
business-critical, personal and 
professional development training.
We also place emphasis on continuous 
learning, career development and 
employees taking full ownership of their 
growth, guided by their manager and 
supported through enterprise tools 
and solutions.
Employees can use internal AI-based 
platforms to manage how they learn, find 
new roles, and develop their skills and 
experiences through new projects, job 
rotations, mentoring or volunteering. 
We invest in our leaders to strengthen 
their ability to lead and develop people, 
navigate complexity, and deliver collective 
impact. We develop our leaders based on 
their needs and role, through training 
programs and on-demand measures, such 
as individual coaching and team 
effectiveness resources.
Our approach to managing performance 
includes frequent check-ins between 
managers and employees on goals, career 
development, feedback and wellbeing. 
It is designed to focus teams on activities 
that create the greatest near- and long-
term impact. 
Mental health and wellbeing
We offer support and learning tools to 
help employees care for themselves and 
others by prioritizing their mental health 
and wellbeing. Through global and local 
campaigns and engagement activities, we 
build awareness and de-stigmatize the 
conversation around mental health.
We maintain a Wellbeing Index, based on 
our quarterly employee engagement 
survey, which monitors perceptions of 
work-life balance and our commitment to 
wellbeing.
This data is used to customize our mental 
health and wellbeing offerings. For example, 
we have a training program for Mental 
Health First Aiders, who are equipped with 
the skills and confidence to have supportive 
confidential conversations with coworkers 
and peers, and guide them to the 
appropriate professional support if needed.
Fostering belonging
To build a fair and inclusive workplace, we 
embed principles of fairness, equal 
opportunity, and belonging in internal 
policies and controls, including our Code 
of Ethics. 
All employment decisions at Novartis are 
based solely on job-related factors, 
including the skills, qualifications, and 
experience of the individual, without

regard to gender, race, ethnicity, or any 
other protected characteristics, as defined 
by applicable local laws. Novartis, as a 
global company, complies with the laws of 
each country within which it operates.
Gender balance, which seeks to provide 
equal opportunities to both men and 
women and is a key element of our 
strategy for eliminating the gender pay 
gap globally, is an important part of our 
people strategy. This is exemplified by the 
commitments we made with the Equal Pay 
International Coalition (EPIC) in 2018 to 
help close the gender pay gap. These 
commitments included monitoring pay, 
excluding historical salary data from our 
recruitment processes, creating pay 
transparency, and achieving gender 
balance in management. 
To sustain our progress, we renewed our 
EPIC pledge in 2023 with aspirational 
goals for 2027. These are: to maintain 
gender-balanced representation in 
management; to review our human 
resources practices beyond base pay to 
eliminate any further potential sources of 
bias from the system; and to make the 
requirements of the new EU Pay 
Transparency Directive our global 
minimum standard for pay equity and pay 
transparency reporting.
Novartis is a member of the International 
Labour Organization Global Business and 
Disability Network and the Valuable 500, 
promoting inclusion for people with 
disabilities in the workplace. We also 
collaborate with international partners, 
such as Disability:IN, Purple Space and 
Business Disability Forum, to identify and 
develop best practice solutions to enable 
people with disabilities to participate as 
equal members of our organization. 
Examples of this work include increasing 
physical and digital accessibility while 
integrating disability perspectives in 
relevant standards and practices. 
In accordance with the UN Standards of 
Conduct for Business, we also strive to 
tackle discrimination against employees 
who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, queer and intersex (LGBTQI).  
More than 80 employee resource groups 
for business-related and cultural topics, 
which are open to all employees from all 
backgrounds, create a sense of belonging 
while offering members an opportunity for 
personal growth and development. 
Equal pay and benefits 
Pay equity (i.e. paying employees fairly for 
similar work based solely on job-related 
factors) is a fundamental principle of our 
employment policies, reflecting a 
commitment in our Code of Ethics to treat 
all employees fairly and respectfully. In 
addition to our EPIC pledge, we are

committed to paying employees a living 
wage that meets or exceeds the amount 
for basic living needs, in line with our UN 
Global Compact commitment.
We offer a range of competitive local and 
global benefits. Our local Novartis 
retirement, health and welfare plans 
protect employees against the financial 
consequences of disability or death, and 
provide attractive retirement benefits 
aligned with local social security 
requirements.
Our Employee Share Purchase Plan 
(ESPP) enables permanent employees to 
voluntarily purchase Novartis shares at a 
15% discount. The plan covers a majority 
of Novartis employees and its rollout to 
additional countries is assessed annually. 
We provide a flexible, hybrid work 
environment that allows employees to 
balance their professional and personal 
responsibilities. 
Parental leave is available to all employees 
regardless of gender or sexual orientation. 
New parents get a minimum of 14 weeks 
paid leave following the birth or adoption of 
a child, ensuring greater flexibility for 
birthing and non-birthing parents.
Our global recognition program, Spark, 
encourages employees to recognize 
colleagues who have demonstrated 
behavior consistent with our culture 
and values. 
Health and safety 
We are committed to occupational health 
and safety and have built this into our 
Code of Ethics. We have an internal health, 
safety and environmental (HSE) 
management system that requires the 
implementation across our sites of strict 
health and safety controls that go beyond 
legal minimum requirements.
We carry out assessments to ensure 
compliance with relevant laws, regulations, 
and internal standards. To monitor 
progress, we use internal targets and 
program goals, and investigate safety 
incidents and near misses.
We actively encourage all employees to 
report incidents, near misses and safety 
improvement opportunities. We require 
sites to carry out annual self-assessments 
of their implementation of the HSE 
management system and a dedicated 
team conducts more focused audits on a 
four-year cycle.
We are also committed to protecting the 
safety of third-party personnel. We assess 
outside contractors and make sure they 
have the right resources and procedures 
in place to be working at our sites. 
Supplier contracts include specific 
occupational health and safety criteria.
Main activities in 2024 
Novartis employed 78 310 people at the 
end of 2024, compared with 78 407 a year 
earlier. In 2024, employee turnover stood 
at 12%, down from 17% a year earlier. 
In 2024, we ramped up the opportunities 
for our people to learn and apply new 
skills through our AI-enabled talent 
marketplace. We also undertook initiatives 
to strengthen our talent attraction, 
development and retention efforts.
For example, we enhanced our Early 
Career program to identify, hire and 
develop early career talent linked to future 
skill gaps, so that the business has pools 
of early career talent with the right 
specialized knowledge, skills and 
experiences. Additionally, we launched AI 
upskilling efforts to equip our workforce 
with the skills to leverage AI technologies, 
driving innovation and improving efficiency.
The proportion of employees represented 
by an employee representative body or 
covered by a collective bargaining 
agreement rose slightly to 54% in 2024.

Pay equity and gender balance
We maintained a gender balance in 
management (providing equal 
opportunities for both men and women to 
advance), with women representing 48% 
of our overall management globally at the 
end of 2024. 
Based on the latest data available as of 
December 31, 2023, women’s earnings at 
Novartis in the aggregate are within one 
percent of men’s, with a global mean pay 
gap of -0.3%.1 This compares with a gap 
of -0.9% in 2022. Companies in the 
benchmark Bloomberg Gender Equality 
Index had a mean pay gap of +17% for the 
same period.
In 2024, we began reviewing our human 
resources practices beyond base pay to 
eliminate any further potential sources of 
gender bias from the system, starting with 
a review of global policies and procedures. 
We also started planning a global program 
to make the requirements of the new EU 
Pay Transparency Directive our global 
minimum standard for pay equity and pay 
transparency reporting. 
In 2024, we rolled-out an LGBTQI 
Ambassador program to provide allyship 
and support to our community across the 
organization.  
Health and safety 
The lost-time incident rate for employees 
remained stable and fell slightly for 
third-party personnel, reflecting the 
continued reinforcement of our internal 
HSE Management system at site level. In 
2024, the implementation of the HSE 
system was reviewed via our internal 
controls process and this assessment 
covered more than 99% of Novartis 
employees.
Human rights 
Impact and risk management
Noncompliance with human rights 
standards and applicable laws and 
regulations could result in negative labor 
and other human rights impacts, exposing 
us to reputational harm and financial losses.
Main policies
Novartis is committed to upholding and 
respecting human rights. In our Code of 
Ethics, we commit to “conduct our 
business in a manner that respects the 
rights and dignity of all people.” This is 
reflected in our Human Rights 
Commitment Statement, which 
establishes our foundational commitment 
to the International Bill of Human Rights, 
the International Labour Organization’s 
core labor conventions and the United 
Nations Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights (UNGPs).
We manage our program through three 
pillars, aligned with the UNGPs: due 
diligence, internal empowerment, and 
stakeholder engagement. 
Due diligence: We conduct ongoing human 
rights due diligence across our business 
and ensure that we have policies and 
management systems in place to support 
our commitments. External partners are 
regularly assessed and monitored against 
the labor and human rights provisions set 
out in our Third Party Code.
We have a monitoring system in place that 
tracks remediation actions regarding 
human and labor rights at external partner 
sites, and their successful resolution 
through time-bound corrective action 
plans. We collaborate with industry 
partners such as the Pharmaceutical 
Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) on topic-
specific supply-chain projects.
Internal empowerment: We work to 
provide access to grievance mechanisms 
for those who may have been affected by 
human rights abuses. 
Stakeholder engagement: We engage 
across industries, listen to stakeholder 
concerns, and take individual or collective 
action. We also engage in collaborative

efforts with stakeholders from civil society, 
investor communities and international 
institutions (e.g., PSCI and Business for 
Social Responsibility’s Human Rights 
Working Group) on our approach to 
human rights.
Main activities in 2024 
In early 2024, we completed our company-
wide annual human rights risk saliency 
assessment. This reaffirmed our focus on 
four previously identified priority areas, 
see the table to on page 37.
In alignment with the evolving regulatory 
landscape on value chain due diligence, 
we also enhanced our external partner 
labor rights due diligence and risk 
assessment framework.
We concluded a pilot project aimed at 
engaging directly with workers in our supply 
chain. This involved a comprehensive 
survey on working conditions. To address 
the survey’s findings, we are actively 
providing ongoing capability-building 
support to strengthen our external partners’ 
ability to implement effective solutions.
In 2024, we continued to develop human 
rights due diligence tools and processes to 
further support our operations in high risk 
and conflict-affected markets. These 
markets present unique challenges that 
require businesses to adapt their strategies 
to navigate and operate effectively.
We published a report on our efforts to 
address modern slavery under UK and 
Australian legislation, as well as reports on 
child labor and conflict minerals in our 
supply chain under Swiss and US 
legislation, respectively. We also published 
our second human rights report under the 
Norwegian Transparency Act.
We periodically assess our obligations 
under Switzerland’s provisions on minerals 
and metals from conflict-affected areas, 
and have established that Novartis falls 
below the thresholds stipulated by the 
Swiss Code of Obligations Art. 964j-l.
Patient health and 
safety 
Impact and risk management
Trust in the safety of our medicines is 
fundamental to our business. If we are 
unable to ensure the quality and safety of 
our medicines, we may negatively impact 
patient health and face product recalls or 
other consequences that impact our 
reputation and our business.
Main policies
We prioritize quality and safety at each 
stage of a medicine’s life cycle. During 
clinical trials and after launch, we monitor 
the use of our medicines to identify 
possible adverse events and minimize 
risks to patients. In the production phase, 
we ensure product quality from raw 
material sampling and testing to 
packaging, testing and distribution of 
finished goods. We also work to identify 
and combat falsified medicines, which can 
pose a serious threat to human health.
Product quality
To ensure product quality, we maintain a 
robust quality management system for our 
medicines in full compliance with 
requirements from health authorities and 
other regulators.
We have licenses and relevant Inter­
national Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) and Good Practice (GxP) certificates 
for all our activities, including clinical trials, 
manufacturing, medical devices, supply, 
warehouse and distribution operations. 
The licenses are typically issued after 
inspections by regulators such as the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA), 
Swissmedic, the Japanese Pharma­
ceuticals and Medical Devices Agency 
(PMDA) and the World Health 
Organization (WHO).
Health authorities regularly inspect our 
facilities to ensure we are complying with 
all relevant laws and standards. We 
conduct thorough investigations whenever 
there is any evidence of deviation from 
these standards, or if we detect failures in 
our processes. We take corrective and 
other measures where applicable, 
including proactively notifying health 
authorities.
All employees and third parties working in 
our facilities take part in comprehensive 
quality and safety training. We require all 
employees involved in manufacturing, 
supply and distribution to attend annual 
training sessions on quality standards. All 
third parties providing services or goods 
manufactured to GxP standards are 
required to have their own quality 
assurance and formal training process. 
Following regulatory guidance (including 
FDA and EMA recommendations), we 
monitor chemical and biological medicines 
for impurities, including those classified as 
“probable human carcinogens” (e.g., 
nitrosamines). Any product identified with 
a potential risk undergoes further 
evaluation and risk management, with 
results submitted to the relevant health 
authorities as required.
We also routinely audit our own operations 
and those of suppliers and other partners 
to ensure quality standards and safety are 
maintained. Furthermore, we are regularly 
audited on our training procedures, and 
training is also included in our audits of 
third parties.
Pharmacovigilance
Pharmacovigilance involves monitoring the 
safety of medicines. Our approach to 
achieve effective pharmacovigilance relies 
on safety monitoring both during drug 
development and in the commercial 
setting, as well as the timely assessment 
and reporting of adverse events. 
This enables us to detect and manage 
pharmacovigilance risks that may emerge 
at any stage of a drug’s life cycle. In 
accordance with international regulations, 
we share periodic safety reports with the 
relevant health authorities. We also 
perform regular benefit-risk analyses for

our medicines to ensure their benefits 
continue to outweigh the risks.
Our pharmacovigilance systems are 
designed to comply with regulatory 
requirements for both individual case 
safety reports and periodic benefit-risk 
assessments. Reports of adverse events 
from various sources — including clinical 
studies, literature and spontaneous 
reports — are used to evaluate and 
optimize risk management actions for the 
proper use of our medicines. 
We also support education programs for 
patients, providers and pharmacists, and 
provide regular training to employees in 
adverse-event reporting. For some 
medicines, post-approval studies may be 
conducted to collect more data on 
possible long-term adverse effects.
Falsified medicines
Falsified medicines pose significant health 
risks and are a growing global concern. 
The Pharmaceutical Security Institute 
reported a 4% increase in pharmaceutical 
crime incidents worldwide in 2023 — an 
increase for the third consecutive year.1
Our efforts to combat falsified medicines 
are focused on mitigating risks across 
three distinct areas: counterfeiting, theft 
and illegal diversion, where products 
intended for one market are intercepted 
and sold in another.
Our strategy is focused on greatly 
accelerating the timely authentication and 
reporting of counterfeit medicines. Trained 
local teams are equipped with mobile and 
digital field-testing solutions, including a 
mobile app (MoVe) for packaging 
verification and a hand-held testing device 
(Authentifield) for product authentication.
We also use intelligence tools and have 
equipped most impacted markets with 
toolkits to help them develop capabilities 
to mitigate the risks of illegal diversion.
Further, we have strengthened our supply 
chain security capabilities and governance 
to improve our ability to mitigate incidents 
of product theft in high-risk regions.
Overall, we continuously work with public 
and private stakeholders to encourage 
coordinated action on falsified medicines 
and protect patients’ safety.
Main activities in 2024

experienced four recalls of nonconforming 
products, less than half the number in 
2023. Of these, two were associated with 
moderate risk to patients (Class II recalls), 
though no patients experienced negative 
effects. Two batches of Pluvicto were 
recalled in the US before reaching patients 
due to a visual inspection error, and six 
batches of Tegretol were recalled at the 
request of the Panamanian health 
authority after we notified them of higher 
than normal ethylene glycol levels. None of 
the other 81 countries notified requested a 
recall based on the favorable risk-benefit 
assessment.
In 2024, health authorities including the 
EMA, Swissmedic and FDA carried out a 
total of 124 inspections of Novartis clinical 
and manufacturing operations. All the 
health authority inspections were deemed 
acceptable, compared with 99.1% in 2023.
We conducted 809 internal and external 
GxP audits in 2024, compared with 926 in 
2023. External suppliers accounted for 
88.4% of the audits. Should we discover 
any gaps during the audit, the audited 
entities are expected to resolve these 
through corrective and proactive actions 
(CAPAs). We monitor these and track 
adherence to the commitments to drive 
continuous improvement.
We successfully completed our first 
ISO 9001:2015 surveillance audit in 2024 
without any nonconformities. 
Pharmacovigilance
Novartis is working to transform its 
pharmacovigilance system, using 
technologies such as artificial intelligence 
to simplify processes and generate new 
safety insights for health authorities, 
healthcare providers and patients. 
Falsified medicines
In 2024, we investigated every confirmed 
incident of falsified medicines reported to 
us — preventing falsified medicines from 
reaching and harming patients.
Counterfeits, which often lack active 
ingredients, continue to be a significant 
concern and represent the highest patient 
safety risk. In 2024, we significantly 
increased the number of countries in 
which Authentifield devices are deployed 
and activated to 69, expanding our timely 
field product authentication capabilities 
from packaging (MoVE) to drug product 
(Authentifield). As a result, we conducted 
more field authentication tests on most 
at-risk products that impact patient safety.
This solution was recognized as a key 
initiative for building supply chain 
capabilities in the 2024 Access to 
Medicines Index (ATMI).

We also maintained our commitment to 
the timely reporting of incidents of 
falsified medicines in 2024. We promptly 
notified local health authorities as required 
while also voluntarily reporting 100% of 
reportable incidents to the WHO within 
the recommended 10-day window.
Access to medicines: 
a shared responsibility
Impact and risk management
Millions of people worldwide face 
significant barriers to accessing basic 
healthcare services and medicines. These 
challenges stem from a combination of 
demographic, social, and economic 
disparities — ranging from aging 
populations and poverty to inadequate 
healthcare infrastructure and workforce 
shortages. While pharmaceutical 
companies contribute through the 
development of innovative treatments, 
addressing these challenges requires the 
collective action of a larger ecosystem. 
Governments, payers, NGOs, and 
community organizations must all work 
together to develop the policies, 
infrastructure, and partnerships needed 
to ensure timely access to healthcare 
services and medicines. 
These systemic barriers also extend to the 
complex process of registering and 
distributing medicines globally. To bring a 
pharmaceutical product to market, a 
registration dossier containing evidence of 
the product’s safety, efficacy, and quality 
must be submitted to regulatory 
authorities. Depending on the country, this 
process can take months or even years, 
influenced by the efficiency of the 
regulatory body and nature of the product. 
Furthermore, the negotiation of selling 
prices or reimbursement levels with 
regulators and payers often delays 
availability, while cost-containment 
measures — such as government-imposed 
price reductions and reference pricing 
systems — can further limit access to 
medicines.
Failure to tackle these challenges 
collectively risks not only delaying access 
to medicines for patients but also 
impacting public trust, reputation and 
business sustainability. Therefore, a 
holistic effort — focused on patient-
centered solutions, regulatory innovation, 
and shared accountability — is essential to 
bridging the gap between innovation and 
accessibility. 
Main policies
Our access policies are designed to 
ensure we do our part to address 
affordability, availability and equity in 
healthcare, while recognizing that 
meaningful progress requires 
collaboration across the entire healthcare 
ecosystem. Our commitment is guided by 
the belief that innovative medicines and 
healthcare solutions should be available to 
all who need them, regardless of 
geographic or economic barriers. To 
achieve this, we integrate access 
considerations into the various stages of 
our work, from research and development 
to distribution and pricing strategies.
Research and development 
We systematically assess our R&D 
portfolio against unmet medical needs, 
integrating access considerations early in 
the development process. By the end of 
Phase II, we anticipate potential access 
barriers and enablers to ensure our 
investigational medicines have the 
potential to reach patients that could 
benefit the most.
Diverse patient representation in clinical 
trials is critical to our R&D efforts. 
Understanding how patients from 
different demographic groups respond to 
treatment is essential to developing 
effective and inclusive medicines. To this 
end, we incorporate diversity principles 
into all Phase III studies with US 
participation, aligning with FDA guidance. 
Our teams establish enrollment goals 
based on disease prevalence and 
demographic factors such as race 
ethnicity, sex and age to recruit a 
representative US population.
Additionally, we provide training for 
employees in R&D to ensure the inclusion 
of underrepresented populations in clinical 
trials, reinforcing our commitment to 
developing medicines that serve the 
broadest range of patients worldwide.
Access strategy for new product 
launches
For each new product launch, we work to 
address non-clinical barriers that may 
hinder adoption and uptake. By

Sustainability matters
Corporate governance, risk 
management and compensation
collaborating with governments and 
healthcare systems, we develop innovative 
pricing and access solutions tailored to 
the needs of individual markets.
While we aim to make our products 
available globally, we recognize that 
access may vary by country. Factors such 
as regulatory requirements, healthcare 
infrastructure, and pricing frameworks can 
affect availability. In some cases, a product 
may be sold under a different brand name 
or be indicated for specific uses based on 
the needs and policies of a given country.
Pricing of our medicines  
Our pricing strategy is grounded in a 
commitment to value-based approaches 
that prioritize the needs of patients, 
healthcare systems, and society. By linking 
the price of a medicine to the outcomes it 
delivers, we strive to facilitate access to 
innovative treatments while incentivizing 
healthcare systems to focus on effective, 
efficient and sustainable interventions. 
We work closely with payers to implement 
system-level mechanisms that align 
payments with measurable health 
outcomes, helping reduce ineffective 
spending. Where feasible, we also use 
tiered pricing models to ensure 
affordability across diverse geographies 
and patient populations. 
Intellectual property 
Intellectual property (IP) rights are critical 
to our business as they safeguard the 
innovation and investment behind our 
research, development, manufacturing 
and marketing efforts. 
Strong IP protections incentivize 
innovators to pursue local regulatory 
approvals, a prerequisite for selling 
medicines in most markets. As a founding 
member and signatory of the IP principles 
for Advancing Cures and Therapies, we 
support thoughtful and balanced 
approaches to patent practices that aim to 
promote innovation while addressing 
global healthcare needs.
To ensure more patients have the potential 
to benefit from our medicines, we do not 
seek to enforce patents in least developed 
countries (LDCs, as designated by the 
United Nations), low-income countries 
(LICs, as designated by the World Bank), 
or in around 80% of low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs, as designated 
by the World Bank).
Main activities in 2024
Our medicines are sold in approximately 
120 countries worldwide. Across our 
portfolio, in 2024, our medicines reached 
296 million patients around the world.
In 2024, we received 20 approvals in the 
US, EU, Japan and China, including US 
approval for Fabhalta (iptacopan) to treat 
adults with immunoglobulin A nephropathy 
(IgAN), a progressive, rare kidney disease 
in which the immune system attacks the 
kidneys.
We received approval in the US and 
Europe for Kisqali (ribociclib) for use with 
an aromatase inhibitor to treat people with 
HR+/HER2- stage II and III early breast 
cancer who are at high risk of recurrence, 
as well as approval in the US for Scemblix 
(asciminib) to treat adult patients with 
newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive chronic myeloid 
leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP).
We made 29 submissions for regulatory 
approval in our key markets, including in 
the US for atrasentan, which has a 
different mechanism of action to Fabhalta, 
to treat IgAN, and in the EU, China and 
Japan for Fabhalta to treat adult patients 
with C3 glomerulopathy, another rare 
kidney disease.
We implement global access strategies for 
all new medicines launched. For example, 
our global access strategy for Fabhalta 
explores ways to partner with healthcare 
systems to expand access to this novel 
treatment for patients with paroxysmal 
nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

Ethical business 
conduct 
Impact and risk management
Our commitment to high ethical standards 
benefits our people, patients and society 
by promoting trust, transparency and 
responsible practices. By embedding 
ethics in our decision-making, we 
strengthen our relationships with 
stakeholders and contribute to a fairer, 
more accountable healthcare ecosystem.
An ethical culture further reduces risks 
related to compliance, legal exposure, and 
reputational damage.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly 
transforming industries, including ours, by 
enhancing business processes and 
supporting innovation. The rapid adoption 
of AI has created new risks, such as 
amplified biases, non-explainable outputs 
(black boxes), and automated decision-
making processes requiring strong human 
oversight. We are committed to 
establishing a responsible use and 
development of AI within an embedded 
compliance structure.
Governance and integrity matters
Main policies
Ethical culture
Our approach is rooted in our culture and 
values, encouraging our employees to 
always act with integrity. We have a Code 
of Ethics, which is a fundamental part of 
the terms of employment for all employees 
of Novartis globally. It has been developed 
with our employees and is anchored in 
behavioral and decision science.
The Code of Ethics sets out commitments 
that are applicable across our business. It 
applies to all employees, and we further 
clarify our expectations through a suite of 
internal policies and controls.
We conduct mandatory annual training for 
all employees on our Code of Ethics. 
Internal online tools, such as our Ethical 
Decision Explorer, have been designed to 
help employees navigate ethical dilemmas.
In addition, we conduct a global Ethics 
Survey on a regular basis to measure our 
progress in embedding our Code across 
the organization and strengthening our 
ethical culture. We use insights it provides 
to drive conversations at global and local 
levels and take action where needed. 
To maximize the benefits of AI while 
minimizing the risks, we established an AI 
compliance governance structure 
together with diverse teams to assess and 
address the complexity arising out of such 
risks. This compliance governance 
structure helps us to mitigate risks within 
ethical guiding principles. 
We have an Ethical use of Data & 
Technology Policy that, together with the 
AI Risk & Compliance Management 
Framework, contributes to the responsible 
use of AI across Novartis.
Anti-corruption and anti-bribery
Novartis does not tolerate any form of 
bribery, undue influence and/or corruption. 
Our Doing Business Ethically and Conflict 
of Interest policies outline these 
expectations for all employees. We also 
clearly set out our standards in our Code 
of Ethics.
Our Doing Business Ethically policy and its 
supporting handbooks comprise a risk 
framework covering four requirements: (a) 
define clear objectives; (b) identify and 
assess the risk; (c) act appropriately; and 
(d) monitor, reconcile and learn.
To support implementation across our 
organization, the process requirements 
outlined in the supporting activity 
handbooks have been embedded within 
our BeSure system platform. This 
approach ensures that policy, processes 
and systems are integrated and can 
be monitored. 
Bribery and corruption risks in our supply 
chain are addressed by our Anti-Bribery 
Third Party Guideline and Third Party 
Code. The Code is an integral part of 
every supplier contract. Our suppliers are 
regularly surveyed through audits that we 
commission from external companies, 
applying a risk-based approach. 
Working with Norges Bank Investment 
Management, we helped develop an 
anti-bribery reporting standard for the 
pharmaceuticals industry that was issued 
in 2022. We report against this standard, 
which is based on principles such as the 
UN Global Compact and the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. 
Complying with laws, regulations 
and controls – our integrated 
assurance model 
We have an integrated assurance model, 
which involves a comprehensive and 
consistent approach across the company 
to governance, risk management, 
compliance and internal controls. The 
integration is supported by an efficient 
operating model, processes and 
consistent methods, enabled by 
collaboration and data insights.
The integrated assurance model is driven 
by members of the Ethics, Risk and 
Compliance (ERC) function as business 
stewards, in collaboration with 
Internal Audit.

Corporate governance, risk 
management and compensation
As the basis of our integrated assurance 
system, we follow a model for managing 
our risks developed by the Institute of 
Internal Auditors that describes three lines 
of assurance. 
Employees addressing potential risks that 
might arise through their business 
activities represent the first line. Second-
line roles provide expertise, support, 
monitoring and challenge on risk-related 
matters. In the third line, our Internal Audit 
function provides assurance that other 
lines are operating effectively. 
The Corporate ERC Assurance Team 
serves as the backbone of our second line 
of assurance, ensuring one functional 
standard for how we approach assurance, 
including internal review, external partner 
audit activities, and remediation.  
Its scope comprises internal reviews of 
compliance with our Doing Business 
Ethically, Health, Safety and Environment 
(HSE), and Ethical Use of Data and 
Technology policies, guidelines and 
handbooks. Corporate ERC Assurance 
also initiates audits with external partners 
on anti-bribery, labor rights, and HSE. 
Through our Enterprise Monitoring 
Coordination process, we avoid overlaps of 
activities carried out by different assurance 
functions, including Internal Audit. 
As a third-line assurance function, Internal 
Audit assists the Board of Directors and 
the Executive Committee of Novartis 
(ECN) by providing assurance and advice 
on the effectiveness, efficiency and 
adequacy of processes and controls that 
support Novartis in achieving its strategy, 
managing major risks, and ensuring 
compliance with applicable policies, laws 
and regulations. 
Internal Audit works according to an audit 
plan approved by the Board’s Audit and 
Compliance Committee. During 2024, 
Internal Audit carried out 52 audits. These 
include the review of ethical standards.
Our processes — such as Compliance 
Risk Assessment and Monitoring, 
Corporate ERC Assurance reviews, 
internal auditing, and the grievance 
mechanism — are designed to detect and 
prevent misconduct. Where evidence of 
misconduct is detected, we take swift and 
appropriate action. Breaches of the Code 
of Ethics, policies, guidelines or local laws 
result in remedial, corrective or 
disciplinary action up to and including 
termination of employment.  
We adhere to industry codes, including 
the Code on Interactions with Health Care 
Professionals published by the Pharma­
ceutical Research and Manufacturers of 
America (PhRMA) and the Code on 
Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices 
published by the International Federation 
of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & 
Associations (IFPMA). We also work 
through regional and local industry 
associations.
Our policies and programs are informed 
by the United Nations (UN) Convention 
Against Corruption and the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) Convention on 
Combating Bribery of Foreign Public 
Officials. We are a signatory to the UN 
Global Compact (UNGC). 
We are committed to respecting and 
implementing human rights approaches in 
our own operations and supply chain in 
accordance with the UN Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).
The Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance 
(ERC) Officer of Novartis is also a member 
of the Anti-Corruption Leaders Hub, a 
leading group of senior executives from 
global enterprises established by the 
OECD and the US State Department.
The Hub promotes anti-corruption efforts 
through the exchange of strategic insights 
and the implementation of 
multistakeholder actions. The Chief ERC 
Officer is also Co-Chair of the Global 
Future Council on Good Governance of 
the World Economic Forum (WEF), serving 
a two-year term through December 2026.
Our comprehensive compliance 
management system is aligned with these 
recognized international standards and 
best practices, and is designed to prevent, 
detect and correct systemic misconduct.
The aim of this system is to ensure 
compliance not only with applicable laws 
and regulations, but also with our internal 
policies, controls, and the expectations 
of employees to do what is right. A core 
objective of our compliance management 
system is to maintain a culture of integrity 
designed to promote and enable 
ethical behavior.
We continuously evolve this system based 
on many factors, including insights from 
internal and external sources and changes 
in the risk landscape. To measure the 
maturity and effectiveness of our 
compliance management system, we 
conduct regular evaluations of our program 
across more than 270 leading indicators. 
Our annual global compliance e-learning 
provides content to enable employees to 
make the right choices in the course of 
their work, and to perform with integrity. 
Global mandatory compliance e-learnings 
are rolled out to employees, including the 
ECN, and to the Board of Directors.
External contractors, who are hired through 
a temporary staff agency and supervised 
day-to-day by a Novartis employee, are also 
required to take these trainings. We 
mandate external parties who pose a risk 
classified higher than ‘low risk’ to complete 
anti-bribery training. 
SpeakUp grievance mechanism
Employees are required to report actual or 
suspected incidents of misconduct and 
can do so in confidence while being 
protected against retaliation. The 
mechanism is also open to external 
parties. Regular surveys (Employee 
Engagement Survey and Ethics Survey) 
provide insights on how comfortable 
Novartis employees feel to speak up.

Grievances can be filed via webform or 
telephone with an independent external 
service, which is available 24/7. 
Allegations can also be raised with any 
manager or Country President, any 
employee of our ERC, People & 
Organization, Legal or Global Security 
teams, or any representative of the local 
workers council. Our process helps 
ensure that complaints are swiftly 
received, risk-assessed, prioritized, 
investigated and resolved.
Allegations that represent a higher risk to 
Novartis from a reputational, business, 
financial, legal, and/or quality or safety 
perspective are investigated centrally by 
dedicated investigators. Lower-risk cases 
are investigated or addressed locally. 
After closure of an investigation, we have 
a remediation process that allows for both 
the allegation and the root cause to be 
addressed. Higher-risk cases that are 
substantiated undergo a central 
remediation process managed in close 
collaboration with our second line of 
assurance, the Corporate ERC Assurance 
team. This creates focus on ensuring that 
any remediation resulting from 
investigations is prompt, addresses the 
root cause, and is subject to follow-up. 
The SpeakUp Office provides 
regular updates to the Executive 
Committee and to the Board’s Audit 
and Compliance Committee.
Cybersecurity
We have a cybersecurity risk management 
program designed to respond to the threat 
of security breaches, the threat of 
cyberattacks, and to protect and preserve 
the confidentiality, integrity, and continued 
availability of information owned by, or in 
the care of Novartis.
We follow industry best practices to 
manage information security. Novartis has 
risk-based services continuity and systems 
recovery plans in place for key business 
processes, which are tested periodically. 
We also conduct ongoing internal 
vulnerability analyses (including simulated 
hacking), as well as external testing via a 
third-party to ensure the effectiveness of 
our cyber­security controls. 
As part of its enterprise risk management 
oversight, the Risk Committee of our 
Board is responsible for ensuring that 
Novartis has implemented an appropriate 
and effective risk management system 
and process, including annually reviewing 
updates on cybersecurity with the Chief 
Security Officer. For more information, see 
our Annual Report 2024.
Main activities in 2024
In 2024, the annual Code of Ethics training 
achieved a completion rate of 98.3%.
Mandatory compliance training topics 
during the year included external partner 
risk management; anti-bribery; conflicts of 
interest; ethical use of data and technology; 
antitrust and fair competition; insider 
trading; adverse events reporting, and; 
inclusion and belonging.
In 2024, the evaluation of our compliance 
management system confirmed it to be 
mature and well designed. We also 
updated our Antitrust and Fair Competition 
Policy to ensure we continue to engage in 
fair competition and comply with antitrust 
and competition laws worldwide.
In early 2024, we launched our updated 
Trade Sanctions and Export Controls 
Guideline and implemented associated 
internal controls. The Guideline helps 
Novartis employees, contractors and other 
third parties better understand where 
breaches of export controls and trade 
sanctions might arise. It also supports 
employees in making the right decisions 
for our patients, our people and society. 
We published our second anti-bribery 
report in early 2024.
See “Supply chain management” on page 
46 for more information on assessments 
of suppliers in 2024 as part of our 
External Partner Risk Management 
process.
In July 2024, we introduced the Anti-Fraud 
Policy to reinforce our commitment not to 
tolerate any form of fraud. This policy 
follows the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(COSO) Fraud Risk Management Guide 
that has a broad approach to fraud. 
In November 2024, we introduced the 
Ethical use of Data & Technology Policy 
with a communication campaign and 
mandatory training.
In 2024, Novartis did not experience any 
material cybersecurity incidents.
An update of our Business Continuity 
Management (BCM) and Novartis 
Emergency Management (NEM) 
Handbook provides our employees with 
additional details and guidance on how 
to implement BCM and NEM across 
Novartis. It helps us to ensure an 
uninterrupted supply of key products and 
services and to secure our key assets 
and business processes.
In 2024, we updated the Internal Review 
Committee Handbook, the Investigations 
Handbook and the SpeakUp Guidance.

We also launched the ListenUp and 
SpeakUp campaigns, under the umbrella 
of the updated Code of Ethics 
communication campaign. The ListenUp 
campaign aims to equip people managers 
to adequately respond to and address 
issues raised by their team members.
In 2024, a total of 1 607 allegations of 
misconduct were handled by the SpeakUp 
Office, compared with 2 059 in 2023. Of 
the total allegations in 2024, 946 (59%) 
were classified as higher-risk misconduct 
allegations warranting investigation by a 
central team. In 2024, 921 allegations 
related to higher-risk misconduct have 
been substantiated. These include 
allegations reported in previous years and 
concluded in 2024. Lower-risk allegations 
are addressed or investigated locally. 
We observed an increase in IT and data 
privacy allegations being substantiated in 
2024, predominantly linked to data loss 
cases (allegations opened in 2023 were 
also included). The majority of data-loss 
cases are internally classified as higher 
risk allegations, centrally investigated and 
have a high substantiation rate due to 
automated detection measures. The 
number of substantiated allegations 
indicates that the detection measures are 
effective at identifying data leakages. We 
devote substantial resources to monitoring 
for and addressing these cases. In 
addition, regular mandatory training on 
information management, data privacy and 
data use is in place to raise awareness.
Animal welfare 
Impact and risk management
Animal research is a necessary element in 
the development of new treatments in 
pre-clinical research to ensure the safety 
of clinical trials. The use of animals in 
research carries the risk of causing 
physical and psychological harm, including 
pain, stress, or suffering, to the animals 
involved. Failure to uphold high welfare 
standards can result in ethical concerns 
and undermine public trust.
Main policies
We fully support the replacement of 
animals with alternatives wherever 
feasible, while meeting our obligations to 
patients and the expectations of 
regulatory agencies.
Our animal research is governed by our 
Animal Welfare policy, which applies to all 
Novartis-sponsored studies, whether 
internal or external. The policy commits us 
to applying the 3Rs principles — to replace 
animals with other methods where 
possible; to reduce the number of animals 
needed in our studies; and to refine study 
methods to minimize animals’ distress.
We have a grant program to prospectively 
fund 3Rs research projects to validate 
alternatives to animal research, reduce 
animal numbers, and improve the animals’ 
experience.
Main activities in 2024
In 2024, we awarded grants for 3Rs 
research to several proposals, including 
projects to reduce the number of animals 
needed by enhancing genetically modified 
mouse model validation, developing 
multi-cellular spheroid models to 
understand dengue-induced 
hepatotoxicity, and using precision cut 
tissue slices for drug discovery. 
Additionally, we recognized projects aimed 
at improving rodent wellbeing through 
transitional lighting and sheltering rodents 
from bright light.
Political engagement
Impact and risk management
The laws and regulations relevant to the 
healthcare industry are broad in scope, 
are subject to change, and could require 
us to incur substantial costs associated 
with compliance, or to alter one or more of 
our business practices.
Main policies
We engage in dialogue with policymakers 
and other external stakeholders on 
relevant policy topics, including conditions 
for innovation in the life sciences and 
expanding access to medicine. Our aim is 
to represent the Novartis perspective by 
providing data and insights that enable 
informed decision-making.
We assess political, legislative and 
regulatory decisions that have a potential 
impact on patients and our industry. 
Furthermore, we participate in policy 
discussions with partners through various 
stakeholder dialogues and industry 
platforms. Engaging with trade 
associations also facilitates a collaborative 
approach to highlighting and solving 
issues that affect people with disease, and 
to ensuring an environment conducive to

biopharmaceutical innovation. Our focus is 
on jointly creating solutions that help 
communities and society tackle the 
burden of disease. 
The respective Novartis global guideline 
outlines the ethical standards that we 
follow in our engagements with 
policymakers and applies to employees as 
well as external partners working on our 
behalf. External partners are also subject 
to our anti-bribery due-diligence process 
as per our External Partners Risk 
Management Framework before they can 
be engaged. Appropriate training is 
provided to employees. 
For further details, see the Public policy 
page of our corporate website.
Main activities in 2024
In 2024, our primary focus areas included 
advocacy efforts supporting various 
initiatives and policies designed to 
advance healthcare, drive innovation and 
enhance accessibility. 
These efforts involved, for example, 
engagement with European Union 
institutions through EU institutional 
policymakers with special focus on the 
Critical Medicines Alliance, Corporate 
Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, EU 
Pharmaceutical Legislation, Urban 
Wastewater Treatment Directive, and the 
Patent Package. These efforts aimed to 
strengthen supply chains, advocate for 
regulatory and intellectual property 
protections, enhance EU competitiveness, 
and support environmental goals.
In the US, we engaged at both the federal 
and state levels to shape policies on drug 
pricing (e.g., the 340B program), the 
Inflation Reduction Act, and Pharmacy 
Benefit Managers reform. We emphasized 
engagement with policymakers, 
advancement of patient access, and 
efforts to uphold innovation and 
intellectual property protections. 
Supply chain 
management
Impact and risk management
We rely on thousands of external partners 
for key business functions and services, 
which poses risks to Novartis, our 
stakeholders and the environment — for 
example when third parties fail to comply 
with our ethical and business standards or 
external regulations related to 
environmental sustainability, human rights 
and other matters.
Main policies
Our external partner risk management 
(EPRM) framework enables risk 
management in a single, mandatory 
process and system as part of our 
integrated assurance system. The 
framework comprises governance, 
processes and internal controls, and 
applies a risk-based approach.
The due diligence efforts are applied in 
proportion to the level of identified risk, 
which is determined by the probability and 
severity of potential adverse impacts. We 
carry out risk assessments and selected 
audits among external partners in various 
risk areas including human rights; health, 
safety and environment; labor rights; 
information security; anti-bribery and 
corruption, and; business continuity 
management. 
Our EPRM framework is supported by 
our Third Party Code, which sets out the 
standards we oblige external partners to 
comply with, including human rights and 
environmental sustainability. Our Third 
Party Code is consistent with the 
Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative 
(PSCI) principles for responsible supply-
chain management. It is also in line with 
the UNGPs, as well as the OECD due 
diligence guidance for responsible 
business conduct.
Main activities in 2024
In January 2024, we introduced a 
redesigned and largely automated 
process to risk assessments to gain 
speed, improve quality and cover 
additional risk areas (e.g., business 
continuity management and human rights 
risks related to certain raw materials).
All suppliers are subject to risk 
assessments when we engage with them 
and at a regular frequency thereafter. 
Suppliers flagged for high risk are subject 
to an onsite audit by our integrated 
assurance team.
Overall, we identified 2 615 remediation 
actions with our suppliers. Of these, 302 
were associated with human and labor 
rights. The increase of remediation actions 
in 2024 was mainly driven by new 
assessment categories added by the 
Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative 
(PSCI), as well as the finalization of legacy 
supplier assessments.

Corporate governance
Novartis is committed to effective 
corporate governance, and our corporate 
governance framework is intended to 
support sustainable financial performance 
and long-term value creation for our 
shareholders, patients, employees and 
other stakeholders based on our Values 
and Behaviors. For more detailed 
information on corporate governance at 
Novartis, see our Annual Report 2024. 
Our governance 
structure
Our primary governance bodies are the 
Annual General Meeting of shareholders 
(AGM), our Board of Directors, and the 
Executive Committee of Novartis (ECN). 
Each has different roles and responsibilities 
within our overall governance system: 
At the AGM, shareholders approve 
dividend payments, maximum aggregate 
compensation for members of the Board 
and ECN, as well as financial statements, 
the nonfinancial report and other 
disclosures. They also elect the Board 
Chair, members of the Board of Directors, 
members of the Board’s Compensation 
Committee, the Independent Proxy, and 
the external auditor. Shareholders meet 
at least once a year, usually in February 
or March. 
Our Board of Directors has ultimate 
decision-making authority (for those 
decisions not reserved for shareholders). 
The Board operates through five permanent 
committees: Audit and Compliance (ACC); 
Compensation; Governance, Sustainability 
and Nomination (GSNC); Risk (RC); and 
Science & Technology (STC). The Board 
represents the interests of all stakeholders 
and oversees the work of the ECN. It is in 
regular contact with the ECN through 
meetings and monthly CEO reporting.
Led by our CEO, the ECN is responsible 
for operational management, including 
financial performance, as well as 
fulfillment of the company’s purpose, 
strategic priorities and targets. The ECN 
has 11 members, including the CEO and 
Chief Financial Officer, the leaders of our 
organizational units — Biomedical 
Research, Development, Operations, US 
and International — as well as those of 
other functions.
In addition, our external auditor provides 
regular opinions to management and 
shareholders on the company’s compliance 
with applicable reporting laws, standards 
and requirements. 
Composition of the 
Board
All Board members are independent and 
nonexecutive (as defined under the Board 
regulations). Members are elected at the 
AGM for one year only; they may serve a 
maximum of 12 years.
When choosing new members to propose to 
the AGM, the Board aims for a balance of 
skills, expertise and experience. Twelve of 
13 current Board members have experience 
in leadership and management. In addition, 
seven have experience in medicine, 
health­care or R&D, and four in environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) topics. The 
Board considers gender, age, nationality, 
ethnicity, viewpoints, professional 
background and expertise in its selection 
process. 
The Board of Directors is subject to an 
annual self-assessment; every third 
year, this assessment is carried out by an 
external consultant. Board members 
receive regular briefings and trainings 
on ethics, risks and compliance, ESG 
and other relevant topics. In 2024, 
topics covered included the US 
healthcare ecosystem, our updated 
Code of Ethics, and data ethics 
and information management.
Board highlights for 
2024
During 2024, the Board of Directors 
discussed strategic, operational and 
financial issues: 
•	 Oversaw the company’s strategy to 
deliver high-value medicines that 
alleviate society’s greatest disease 
burdens through technology leadership 
in R&D and novel access approaches
•	 Reviewed the development of the talent 
pipeline in the context of strengthening 
the Company’s foundations 
•	 Discussed longer-term Board 
succession planning and required 
profiles, including the nomination of a

Risk management
Our approach
Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
framework is designed to generate a 
holistic view of risks for our company and 
drive a culture of informed risk-taking that 
advances our strategy. 
Our annual ERM process is based on three 
main steps: understanding and adapting to 
the rapidly changing dynamics of our 
external environment; identifying, 
assessing and analyzing potential risks to 
the success of our strategy; and setting a 
clear risk appetite for each risk and taking 
actions to achieve our target risk exposure.
Throughout the year, we hold risk 
workshops with business leaders from 
countries, organizational units and global 
functions. This helps us integrate risk 
management into our activities and better 
understand our risk exposure through 
transparency on how key risks and 
opportunities are evolving. 
Risk exposure is rated on a four-point scale 
— very high, high, medium, and low — based 
on likelihood and potential impact, using the 
‘most-probable worst-case’ scenarios for 
each risk as reference points. We create 
mitigation plans and monitor each risk to 
achieve our target risk exposure.
Overall, our 2024 risk portfolio was similar 
to 2023. We continued to take mitigation 
measures to reduce our net risk exposure 
while updating our ERM framework and 
risk definitions to reflect changes in our 
strategic priorities and business 
environment taking into account risk 
amplifiers such as geostrategy, 
technology acceleration, climate change 
and evolving societal expectations.
Risk governance 
The Board oversees risk management 
systems and processes through its Risk 
Committee. Alongside senior management, 
the Risk Committee reviews the risk 
portfolio, prioritization of risks, and actions 
taken to manage or mitigate risk. It also 
carries out ad hoc reviews of key risk areas.
The ECN assesses risks and fosters a 
culture of risk awareness, in line with our 
Values and Behaviors and Code of Ethics. 
The CEO reviews and validates the annual 
risk portfolio. ECN members are appointed 
as risk owners for relevant strategic risks. 
The ERM process is the responsibility of 
the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance (ERC) 
Officer. It is managed by our internal 
Corporate Ethics, Risk & Compliance 
organization within the ERC function, with 
support from risk leaders in key markets, 
organizational units and functions.
Operational risks

Cybersecurity breaches, data loss and 
catastrophic loss of IT systems
Talent and external workforce management
Inability to identify, attract, develop and retain

Alliances,

Pressure on the pricing of our medicines has many sources, including increasing healthcare 
costs, funding restrictions, increasing pressure on intellectual property protections, and 
policy changes. Legislative developments in the US, Europe and other countries may create 
further pressures on pricing and the availability of our products.
R&D is vital to our strategy. Our ability to grow our business and advance our product pipeline 
depends in significant part on the success of our R&D efforts. We may be unable to develop 
the necessary clinical evidence to achieve the full potential of our assets. In addition, failure to 
successfully implement new technologies such as AI may put us at a competitive disadvantage 
and impact our productivity and pipeline value.
Increasingly, companies are being judged by their performance on environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) matters. Topics related to large societal changes such as climate change 
are increasingly important to a wide range of our stakeholders. Failing to meet our ESG 
commitments could adversely affect our reputation, recruitment, retention, operations, financial 
performance, and share price.
As part of our strategy, we may acquire and divest products or entire businesses and form 
strategic alliances and collaborations to strengthen our pipeline of new medicines and help 
sustain long-term growth. The market for biologics and new technology platforms within our 
core therapeutic areas is highly competitive and there is a risk we will miss out on opportunities 
or be unable to fully realize the strategic benefits of these transactions.
We seek to price our medicines based on the value they deliver to patients, health systems and 
society. We believe this incentivizes health systems to focus on interventions that deliver the 
most effective, efficient and sustainable outcomes. We also work through industry associations 
to advocate for policies that support a sustainable ecosystem for innovative medicines.
We are focusing our efforts on core therapeutic areas and shifting more of our portfolio to new 
technology platforms such as cell and gene therapy, radioligand therapy, and xRNA. To do this, 
we need to have clear strategic objectives, be efficient and set clear priorities, with a focus on 
projects that have the highest potential. We also have a clear AI strategy and are investing in 
the enabling infrastructure, capabilities, and external partnerships needed to scale our most 
promising AI use cases across the R&D continuum.
Building trust with society is part of our corporate strategy. We have developed an ESG 
strategic roadmap with clear targets on material ESG topics. We are also taking steps to further 
strengthen our approach to external partner ESG risk. We monitor changes to ESG regulations, 
particularly regarding new reporting and due diligence requirements. In addition, we have 
policies, controls and internal programs to ensure ESG is embedded in our decision-making.
We have strengthened our internal organization to streamline and focus decision-making by 
creating a new Strategy & Growth function, single business development teams, and leadership 
teams for each of our core therapeutic areas. We have also implemented a single framework for 
portfolio assessment and prioritization.
Key products 
and commercial 
priorities
Delivering on our growth targets requires us to focus on priority brands and markets to 
support new launches and overcome potential barriers to the uptake of new medicines. This 
could be impacted by several factors, including (but not limited to) competitive pressures, 
changes in the prescribing habits of healthcare professionals, and slower than expected 
adoption after launch. Our commercial success depends, among other things, on effective 
transition of assets from development to launch, and sufficient market insight in pipeline and 
commercialization decisions. We operate in competitive and rapidly changing markets and 
could be adversely affected if we fail to keep pace with technological changes.  
We have a clear strategic focus. We are aligning our research, development and commercial 
activities around priority assets in our core therapeutic areas and integrating new technologies

We depend on critical, complex and interdependent IT systems, significant parts of which 
are outsourced to third parties. We also collect, store and transmit confidential information in 
the ordinary course of business, (including but not limited to intellectual property, proprietary 
business information and personal information). Cyberattacks or other IT issues could potentially 
lead to the unavailability of critical systems and/or the loss of confidential information.
Some of our IT systems, platforms and applications may be complex and fragmented or nearing 
the end of their useful life. This may lead to inefficiencies and an increased risk of disruption 
to our operational stability. An inability to successfully implement new IT programs to replace 
outdated systems may prevent us from materializing expected benefits and could lead to 
disruptions.
The laws and regulations relevant to the healthcare industry are broad in scope, are subject 
to change, and could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance, or 
to alter one or more of our business practices. Trust in Novartis and its medicines may be 
eroded if we fail to meet ethical standards or comply with applicable laws and regulations.
We rely on external partners for key business functions and services, including in manufacturing, 
R&D and distribution. This poses certain risks, for example if external partners fail to comply 
with internal controls and regulatory requirements, or fail to meet standards on environmental 
sustainability and human rights.
To maintain the quality of our medicines, we must ensure our manufacturing processes — and 
those of our business partners — meet all regulatory requirements, as well as our own strict 
quality standards. Healthcare systems, healthcare providers and patients rely on us to meet the 
highest quality standards. Failure to do so could result in product recalls or other measures, as 
well as harm to patients and our reputation.
To execute our strategy, we need to attract, develop and retain qualified people — including 
members of our scientific and management teams, R&D specialists and employees with 
key capabilities in key markets. If we are unable to do so, our ability to achieve our business 
objectives may be affected.
We are taking steps to further strengthen cyber defenses by defining recovery and business 
continuity measures that enable us to respond to a catastrophic loss of IT and resume 
operations. We are modernizing our IT infrastructure and replacing end-of-life applications, 
as well as introducing tighter controls around the use of company devices. We are further 
strengthening network security and disaster recovery planning at key sites, including research 
labs and manufacturing facilities.
We are modernizing our IT systems and processes. These foundational programs include 
our Lean Digital Core program to establish global end-to-end systems in the Enterprise 
Resource Management (ERP) space, and a program to update our human resources 
systems. We are working to harmonize data management and improve processes in other 
areas, including supply chain management, compliance and end-to-end Development.
Our internal controls and policies are enforced through regular monitoring and training. We 
are further strengthening our compliance management system, and have launched our Doing 
Business Ethically policy framework supported by a new online platform that helps employees 
manage potential risks of inappropriate influence and bribery.
We contractually oblige suppliers to abide by our standards on quality, ethical business 
conduct, and human rights. We carry out regular risk assessments and audits. We also work 
with suppliers to reduce their environmental impact. We are phasing in a new risk-based 
approach to make our assessments more efficient. We are also further improving our approach 
to human rights, including stronger grievance reporting.
Novartis has extensive policies, systems and controls to ensure product quality. These 
include a companywide Quality Management System, as well as relevant ISO and Good 
Manufacturing Practice certificates and licences for activities such as clinical trials, 
warehousing and distribution. In addition, we have a Quality Risk Management program 
and related risk mitigation actions commensurate with the level of risk. Our facilities are 
also subject to regular, external inspections. We are strengthening our M&A processes by 
implementing thorough reviews of quality systems and processes of acquired companies, 
products or assets. 
We use strategic workforce planning in key areas to ensure we have the right skills and 
capabilities for our strategy. We have extensive succession planning and targeted talent 
scouting. We also monitor turnover risk and employee engagement, and have a system of 
regular evaluations and quarterly check-ins. In recent years, we have adopted new ways of 
working and increasingly recruit from a global pool of talent.
Operational risks
Supply chain
Failure to maintain a reliable supply of our medicines may harm patient health and cause 
significant business disruption and negative reputational impact. Supply could be affected 
by various factors, including quality concerns, natural disasters or accidents, geopolitical 
developments, IT incidents, or failure to source key inputs or raw materials.   
We apply minimum standards to suppliers through our Third Party Code. We assess climate and 
macroeconomic risks through regular risk assessments, and take mitigation measures where 
necessary. With suppliers, we diversify where possible, so that our business is not dependent 
on a single or limited number of supply sources. We continue to strengthen business continuity 
efforts to mitigate the potential impact of geopolitical developments on our supply chain.

Compensation 
2024 company 
performance
Novartis delivered an excellent 
performance in 2024, driven by sales 
growth in key brands and more cost-
effective operations. Compared with the 
prior year, net sales from continuing 
operations increased by 12% measured in 
constant currencies (cc), core operating 
income increased by 22% (cc) and free 
cash flow increased by USD 3.1 billion. 
Sales growth was mainly driven by 
Entresto, Cosentyx, Kesimpta, and Kisqali. 
The Company’s performance led to two 
guidance upgrades for net sales and three 
for core operating income.
The compensation of the members of the 
Executive Committee of Novartis (ECN) is 
largely determined by performance 
evaluations conducted on both a short-
term basis through the Annual Incentive 
and a long-term basis via the Long-Term 
Performance Plan (LTPP).
In 2024, our innovation highlights included 
the approval of Fabhalta in EU, China and 
Japan for adult patients with paroxysmal 
nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), as well 
as in the US for adult patients with 
immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). We 
also received accelerated approval in the 
US for Scemblix for newly diagnosed 
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML) and Kisqali was approved in the EU 
and US to reduce the risk of recurrence in 
people with early breast cancer. 
The company’s performance in 2024 
resulted in a total realized compensation 
for the CEO of CHF 19 165 899, of which 
88.5% was made up of variable 
components, which comprised an Annual 
Incentive at 160% of target and a 2022-
2024 LTPP at 158% of target. The LTPP 
represents the largest component of the 
realized compensation. 
The 2022-2024 LTPP cycle delivered 
strong results versus target, with both 
third-party sales CAGR (compound annual 
growth rate) and core operating income 
CAGR (both in cc) exceeding the level 
required for a maximum payout. Three-
year sales performance from growth 
brands Entresto, Pluvicto, Kesimpta and 
Kisqali, all considerably exceeded 
expectations. Our bottom line was further 
strengthened through savings generated 
by our organizational transformation. 
Innovation performance was solid, as 
evidenced by the advances listed above. 
Our share price performance and year-on-
year dividend increases resulted in a total 
return to shareholders of 54% over the 
performance cycle which ranked 5th out 
of our 15 global healthcare peer 
companies (including Novartis). In addition, 
the 2022-2024 LTPP cycle payout 
accrued a 15.5% increase in share price 
between grant and vesting. In line with our 
plan rules, an additional two-year holding 
period applies for the CEO (and CFO) 
vested shares (i.e. until January 2027). 
The Board of Directors did not make any 
discretionary adjustments to the incentive 
outcomes.
The performance outcomes described 
above also contributed to the total 
aggregated realized compensation of 
the other ECN members which was 
CHF 56 580 414.
Compensation system 
changes
At the beginning of 2024, the Board of 
Directors incorporated significant 
changes into our executive compensation 
system, which were shaped with input 
from our shareholders as described in 
detail in last year’s Compensation Report. 
These changes were strongly supported 
at the 2024 Annual General Meeting 
(AGM). We are confident that the changes 
place us in a better position to attract and 
retain the best talent on a global scale. No 
further material changes were made to the 
2025 Executive Committee compensation 
system.
Shareholder votes on 
compensation
As in prior years and in line with the Swiss 
Code of Obligations and our Articles of 
Incorporation, at the 2025 AGM, 
shareholders will be asked to approve the 
maximum aggregate amount of 
compensation for the Board of Directors 
of CHF 8 200 000, which is lower than the 
amount requested in the previous term. 
This is due to the Board Chair fee change 
as well as the lower number of nominated 
Board members (12 members will be 
nominated for election at the 2025 AGM 
compared to 13 at the 2024 AGM). For the 
members of the Executive Committee, 
the maximum aggregate amount 
proposed to shareholders is 
CHF 95 000 000, which remains the 
same as in the previous year. 
Full details on compensation for the CEO, 
other Executive Committee members and 
Board members can be found in the 
Compensation Report of our Annual 
Report 2024, and in the compensation 
votes at the 2025 AGM.

∆	2024 data in scope for external limited assurance
1	 Environmental data for the current year is based on actual performance data from January to September, with estimates for October to 
December, unless indicated otherwise. Any significant deviations from actuals data against these estimates will be restated for 2024 in 
our sustainability report the following year. 2022 and 2023 reflect full year actuals data. Data from the Novartis entity Abadia Retuerta is 
included in the 2024 environmental data
2	 Reflects purchase of electricity that can be attributed to renewable sources in line with RE100 technical criteria
3	Novartis follows the GHG Protocol for calculating the greenhouse gas emissions unless adjustments are required to comply with local 
regulations
4	Novartis discloses Scope 3 emissions categories that are considered relevant in 2024 including newly disclosed categories. 2023 and 
2022 data has been updated accordingly
5	 Scope 3 data for the current year is based on actuals from January to November, with estimates for December
6	The indicator is calculated using 12-month actual data
7	 2023 and 2022 water usage performance indicators have been updated from the prior year published performance indicators to include 
the Novartis entity Abadia Retuerta and a revised estimate from the Sandoz/ Novartis split for manufacturing operations in Austria after 
segregated meter reading data was available. This reduced the previously reported performance indicators of total water withdrawals by 
5% in 2023 and by 8% in 2022, total water discharges by 5% in 2023 and 8% in 2022, and total water consumption increased by 3% in 
2023 and 0% in 2022. Additionally, the definition for water consumption was changed to align with the GRI standards. In previous years, 
water discharged via treatment was included in water consumption and it has now been classified as water discharged
8	Water withdrawal includes water used for cooling and returned to the environment without the need for additional treatment
9	Total volume of water withdrawn by an organization, less any water discharged outside of the site boundaries through municipal waste 
water systems or directly to aquatic environments. This definition was changed to align with the GRI standards

Disclosures (TCFD)
Water stress
Heat stress
Description, methodology and results discussion
Water stress measures the scarcity of regional or local water availability, and is increasing under the impact of climate change and human activity. Lower efficiency or a shutdown of water-intensive production 
processes caused by such events could impact revenues. 
To quantify our exposure to water stress, we used “human water demand / water supply for the local and upstream watersheds”. Our manufacturing sites in Pakistan, Belgium, Netherlands, Indonesia and China were 
classified as high or very high risk for water stress.
Extreme heat conditions could increase operating costs by augmenting our cooling needs and energy consumption to protect the health of employees and ensure processes and equipment operate efficiently. 
To quantify our exposure, we used cooling degree days indicating a need for air conditioning. Temperature rise is a significant risk across all sites. Heat stress exposure is most pronounced at our manufacturing 
sites in Singapore, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, and is seen increasing at these locations by 2050. Heat risk increases from high to very high at our R&D site in India, and at our offices and 
warehouses in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malaysia, India and Saudi Arabia.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Jupiter Intelligence ClimateScore™ Global, Novartis site-specific data
All Novartis operating sites (including manufacturing sites, R&D sites, offices) and primary and secondary warehouses
We screened sites for exposure to 18 different temperature-, water- and wind-related acute and chronic physical risks;1 risks with no or limited impact on sites were scoped out; 
the analysis focused on sites with high or very high risk by 2050 in SSP5-8.5
	
– Revenue (water stress, cyclones, flooding, drought): to estimate revenue loss, we mapped potential downtime resulting from the change in the chosen metric vs baseline,2 
across the time horizon and scenarios, and used this in conjunction with an estimate of site-level revenue.
	
– Operating costs (heat stress):3 to estimate an increase in operating costs from higher cooling costs, we used an economic impact metric from the Jupiter Intelligence ClimateScore™ Global, 
“annual cost of electricity used for cooling”, in conjunction with site-level annual cooling cost estimates. 
	
– Property, plant and equipment / inventories (cyclones, flooding):3 we used a damage function from Jupiter Intelligence ClimateScore™ Global in conjunction with site-level property, 
plant and equipment / inventory values to generate average annual loss (building and contents / inventory).

Flooding
Drought
Physical risk
With the increase in temperatures brought by climate change, flooding or extreme rainfall are set to become more common in different parts of the world. Flooding could lead to disruption or delays in manufacturing 
processes and interruptions in supply and distribution of products. Similar to cyclones, it could also result in damage to our property, plant and equipment, and to our inventories.
To quantify our exposure to the flooding peril, we used the Jupiter Intelligence metric “depth of the water (in meters) at the 100-year return period”. By 2050, three manufacturing sites in Switzerland, Italy and 
Bangladesh were classified as very high risk, and two in Belgium and Italy as high risk. Three offices, in Bangladesh, France and Japan, were classified as very high risk across the time horizon, and one warehouse in 
India sees a significant increase in its risk classification to very high by 2050. Similarly, one R&D site in the US is classified as high risk by 2030, in all scenarios.
Drought conditions are set to worsen in terms of frequency, length and severity due to the impact of climate change. They could potentially impact revenue through business interruption, should these events lead to 
temporary site closures.
To quantify our exposure to the drought peril, we used a metric that characterizes extreme meteorological drought conditions, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), more specifically 
“months per year where the rolling 6-month average SPEI is below -2”. Four of our manufacturing sites with low baseline risk — in Egypt, Belgium, Netherlands and Turkey — are classified as high risk in a middle-
of-the-road SSP2-4.5 scenario by 2040. By 2050, in a very high emissions SSP5-8.5 scenario, 16 manufacturing sites are at high or very high risk. Meanwhile offices and warehouses that are already classified 
as high risk in countries including Greece, Israel and Turkey, become very high risk by 2050.

ND-GAIN5 draws on more than 40 indicators to measure current vulnerability to disruptions and readiness to leverage private and public sector investment for adaptive actions1
Revenue: We mapped the revenue contribution of our tier 1 suppliers in conjunction with physical climate risk assessment from ND-GAIN
Description, methodology and results discussion
To estimate the supply chain spend exposed to physical climate risk, we measured total procurement spend for 2023 and assessed supplier data for materiality using the criteria spend, asset tangibility 
(dependence on physical assets) and substitutability (existence of alternative suppliers). Shortlisted suppliers were assessed for climate risks using ND-GAIN data (2023), which measures country-level vulnerability 
and readiness based on over 40 indicators. OECD data (2021) on asset tangibility was used to gauge sector vulnerability. Country and sector risk scores were combined to produce a final score from 1 to 25, 
categorized from very low (<3) to very high (>15). Suppliers with high and very high risk, as well as suppliers with medium risk but high asset tangibility, were retained in the analysis.

Description, methodology and results discussion
Cyclones
Cyclones and strengthened wind speeds can have potential financial implications through interruptions at our sites or via damage to our property, plant and equipment, and to our inventories.
To quantify our exposure, we used the Jupiter Intelligence metric “maximum 1-minute sustained wind speed (in km/h) experienced at the 200-year return period”. Two of our manufacturing sites in Japan and 
Pakistan, one R&D site in China, and four warehouses in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Philippines and India are exposed to high or very high risk of cyclones.

Carbon pricing
Description, methodology and results discussion
Carbon prices, in the form of emissions trading or carbon taxes, are likely to continue to increase in major operating and supplier countries, which may lead to rising operating costs for Novartis. Carbon pricing can impact 
Novartis as 1) a direct charge on Scope 1 emissions that fall under emissions schemes such as the EU ETS, 2) via purchased energy as a pass-through cost from electricity generators; 3) as a charge on emissions of 
suppliers who pass through part of their costs to Novartis, and 4) as a charge to buy the necessary Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) certificates for the emissions embedded in Novartis imports.
To quantify our Scope 1 and 2 exposure to carbon pricing, we followed five steps: 1) we assigned carbon prices (IEA World Energy Outlook 2023 forecast prices) across the time horizon and scenarios to each 
country in which we had Scope 1 or 2 emissions; 2) we measured Scope 1 and 2 emissions by country; 3) we multiplied Scope 2 emissions by 100%, assuming a 100% pass-through rate from electricity suppliers; 4) 
we multiplied Scope 1 and 2 emissions by the corresponding country-level carbon price forecast; and 5) we multiplied the resulting carbon costs by our Scope 1 and 2 SBTi emissions reduction targets for 2030 (90%) 
and 2040 (90%), assuming we maintain emissions at the 2040 level also by 2050. This approach assumed that all sites have to pay the full carbon price and all site emissions are covered by the carbon price.
Across all the jurisdictions considered in the analysis, the risk was highest in the following countries, due both to high carbon prices and country-level total emissions: US, Austria, Slovenia, Italy, France, Singapore, 
UK, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland.
To quantify our Scope 3 exposure to carbon pricing, we followed similar steps: 1) we measured country-level Scope 3 emissions data for our Category 1 (purchased goods and services) and Category 2 (capital goods) 
supplies, representing more than 85% of our Scope 3 emissions; 2) we assigned carbon prices (IEA World Energy Outlook 2023 forecast prices) across the time horizon and scenarios to each country; 3) we multiplied 
Scope 3 emissions by 70%, assuming a 70% pass-through rate from our suppliers; 4) we multi-plied Scope 3 emissions by the corresponding country-level carbon price forecast; 5) we multiplied the resulting carbon 
costs by our Scope 3 SBTi emissions reduction targets for 2030 (42%) and 2040 (90%), assuming we maintain emissions at the 2040 level also by 2050; and 6) we estimated the percentage of our Scope 3 emissions 
imported to the EU in our baseline year, and using a sector-based approach, we assumed which percentage of these may gradually become subject to the CBAM across the time horizon, using the ­difference between 
the EU carbon price and the respective country’s carbon price to calculate the impact.
Carbon certificates 
pricing
To meet our emission targets, our primary focus is on absolute reductions. For our 2025 target of carbon neutrality from energy in own operations, however, we will invest in carbon removal offsets for residual 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions. For our 2040 net-zero targets, we will align with SBTi’s Corporate Net-Zero standard requirements for offsets e.g. max 10% of Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions.
Novartis has an offsets outlook determined by a) the credit volumes required to meet its emissions reduction targets (2025, 2030 and 2040), b) the preferred contribution of nature-based solutions vs engineering 
removals to the total volume, across the time horizon and c) its opted-in offset prices. 
To calculate the potential risk or opportunity associated with our offsets outlook up to 2050, we stress-tested our baseline outlook against Bloomberg New Energy Finance offset price forecasts (BNEF) to 2050. 
Keeping the same relative nature-based solutions (NbS) vs engineering removal contribution as in our baseline, and the same volume of offsets required, we used the following BNEF forecasts: for the low price 
scenario – BNEF’s voluntary market (assuming inelastic demand) for NbS offsets and BNEF’s BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) offset cost for engineering removals; for the high price scenario – 
BNEF’s high-quality bifurcation scenario (inelastic demand) for NbS offsets and the BNEF direct air capture offset cost for engineering removals.
Transition risks and opportunities
Risks considered
We assessed 18 risks and opportunities1 out of a longlist of 33 factors for impact materiality to Novartis. We drew up a shortlist of transition risks and opportunities for both climate mitigation and adaptation, and 
grouped these into three categories: litigation and reputational risk (qualitative assessment), carbon pricing and switch to low-carbon alternatives (quantitative), and changing demand for healthcare (quantitative).

Changing demand 
for healthcare
Factors including changing temperature and pollution patterns are increasingly being analyzed for their correlation to the prevalence or severity of some diseases.
To measure our exposure to such changes, we started with a longlist of products (top growth commercial products up to 2030 and our pipeline), and used IHME and other scientific literature to establish whether 
climate risk (temperature/pollution) is significant for the diseases treated by the respective products. Where there was a correlation, products were shortlisted for further analysis, along with other Novartis products 
treating a similar disease. These products were used as a proxy to determine climate-related demand associated with the disease area.
Across all time horizons modelled, on average we see a potential sales decrease for medicines used to treat ischemic heart disease, asthma and lung cancer, due to expected declines in pollution levels. For lung 
cancer, results vary by region, with a decrease in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) related to particulate matter in the US and Europe, and an increase in the regions Asia, Africa and Australasia, and Canada and 
Latin America. Meanwhile, across all regions, there is an opportunity to increase sales for products used to treat renal diseases, with the effect most pronounced in Asia, Africa and Australasia.
For each disease area, we calculated the percentage of climate-related DALYs out of total DALYs, and multiplied this by country-level product sales to generate a climate-related sales baseline. To calculate how 
this might change, we multiplied the climate-related sales baseline by the percentage change in climate-related DALYs vs baseline across the time horizons and scenarios. For pipeline products, we calculated the 
revenue impact based on every future USD 1 million sales for the product in one year.

Changing demand for healthcare
1	 The potential savings in electricity costs exclude the impact associated with our direct consumption of fuel (e.g. natural gas), primarily used to generate thermal energy
2	 We do not expect material risk in the short term from climate-related changes in demand for healthcare.
Electricity costs
Prices for electricity generated from renewable energy are lower than those from fossil fuel energy and are expected to fall further. This may result in lower operating costs from electricity use, either through lower 
market prices, cheaper power purchase agreements (PPAs) or onsite renewable energy generation.
To calculate this transition opportunity, changes in different electricity technology costs over time were applied to the respective electricity grid mix in each climate scenario. The model uses country-level IEA 
electricity generation data to show how the power mix changes in the different scenarios. It uses 2030 and 2050 IEA changes in levelized costs of energy (LCOE) as a proxy for changes in average costs of 
electricity in all countries.
In all scenarios, renewables increase their share in the generation mix while their LCOEs decrease. The opportunity is measured as the percentage difference between the current electricity costs in each country 
and the electricity costs associated with the future grid. 
The model separately assumes that Novartis meets its 100% renewables target by 2025 and maintains it thereafter.
Our final results show the additional cost savings, beyond those incurred already from the changes in the future electricity grid, by subtracting these from the changes incurred from switching to 100% renewables.1

Independent practitioner’s limited assurance report 
on selected Sustainability Information of Novartis AG
To the Board of Directors of 
Novartis AG
We have undertaken a limited assurance 
engagement on Novartis AG’s (hereinafter 
“Novartis”) Sustainability Information on 
pages 28, 30, 32, 35, 40, and 60 to 62 
marked with the symbol ∆ (hereinafter 
“Sustainability Information”) in the Novartis in 
Society Integrated Report for the year ended 
December 31, 2024 (the “Report”). 
Our assurance engagement does not extend 
to information in respect of earlier periods or 
to any other information included in the 
Report, the Novartis Annual Report, Form 
20-F or displayed elsewhere on Novartis’s 
website for the current year or for previous 
periods unless otherwise indicated, including 
any images, audio files or embedded videos.
Understanding how Novartis 
has Prepared the Sustainability 
Information
Novartis prepared the Sustainability 
Information using criteria as outlined here 
(hereinafter “Reporting Criteria”). The 
Reporting Criteria have been developed to 
assist Novartis in preparing the performance 
information for selected ESG performance 
indicators; and for ESG performance 
indicators used to measure progress against 
its ESG targets. Consequently, the 
Sustainability Information needs to be read 
and understood together with the Reporting 
Criteria. As a result, the Sustainability 
Information may not be suitable for another 
purpose.
Our Limited Assurance Conclusion
Based on the procedures we have performed 
as described under the ‘Summary of the work 
we performed as the basis for our assurance 
conclusion’ and the evidence we have 
obtained, nothing has come to our attention 
that causes us to believe that the 
Sustainability Information in the Report for 
the year ended 31 December 2024 is not 
prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
Our conclusion is to be read in the context of 
the remainder of this report, in particular the 
“Inherent limitations in preparing the 
Sustainability Information” and “Intended use 
and distribution of our report” sections 
below.
We do not express an assurance conclusion 
on information in respect of earlier periods or 
on any other information included in the 
Report, Novartis Annual Report or Form 
20-F, including any images, audio files or 
embedded videos.
Inherent Limitations in Preparing the 
Sustainability Information
Due to the inherent limitations of any internal 
control structure, it is possible that errors or 
irregularities may occur in disclosures of the 
Sustainability Information and not be 
detected. Our engagement is not designed to 
detect all internal control weaknesses in the 
preparation of the Sustainability Information 
because the engagement was not performed 
on a continuous basis throughout the period 
and the assurance procedures performed 
were on a test basis.
The nature of non-financial information; the 
absence of significant body of established 
practice on which to draw; and the methods 
of precision used to determine non-financial 
information, allow for different, but 
acceptable evaluation and measurement 
techniques and can result in materially 
different measurement, affecting 
comparability between entities and over time. 
 Novartis’s Responsibilities
The Board of Directors of Novartis is 
responsible for:
•	Selecting or establishing suitable criteria 
for preparing the Sustainability Information, 
taking into account applicable law and 
regulations related to reporting the 
Sustainability Information;
•	The preparation of the Sustainability 
Information that is free from material 
misstatement in accordance with the 
Reporting Criteria;
•	Designing, implementing, and maintaining 
internal control over information relevant 
to the preparation of the Sustainability 
Information that is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error; and
•	The contents and statements contained 
within the Report and the Reporting 
Criteria.
Our Responsibilities
We are responsible for:
•	Planning and performing the engagement 
to obtain limited assurance about whether 
the Sustainability Information is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error;
•	Forming an independent conclusion, based 
on the procedures we have performed and 
the evidence we have obtained; and
•	Reporting our conclusion to the Board of 
Directors of Novartis AG.
As we are engaged to form an independent 
conclusion on the Sustainability Information 
as prepared by management, we are not 
permitted to be involved in the preparation of 
the Sustainability Information as doing so 
may compromise our independence.
Professional Standards Applied
We performed a limited assurance 
engagement in accordance with 
International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements 3000 (Revised) Assurance 
Engagements other than Audits or Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information, issued by 
the International Auditing and Assurance 
Standards Board (“IAASB”) and, in respect 
of the greenhouse gas emissions 
information included within the

Sustainability Information, in accordance 
with International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements 3410 Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas 
Statements, issued by the IAASB. 
Our Independence and Quality 
Control
We have complied with the independence 
and other ethical requirements of the 
International Ethics Standards Board for 
Accountants’ (“IESBA”) International Code of 
Ethics for Professional Accountants 
(including International Independence 
Standards), which is founded on fundamental 
principles of integrity, objectivity, professional 
competence and due care, confidentiality 
and professional behavior.
Our firm applies International Standard on 
Quality Management 1, which requires the 
firm to design, implement and operate a 
system of quality management including 
policies or procedures regarding compliance 
with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements.
Our work was carried out by an independent 
and multidisciplinary team including 
assurance practitioners and sustainability 
experts. We remain solely responsible for our 
assurance conclusion.
Summary of the Work we Performed 
as the Basis for our Assurance 
Conclusion
We are required to plan and perform our 
work to address the areas where we have 
identified that a material misstatement of the 
Sustainability Information is likely to arise. 
The procedures we performed were based 
on our professional judgment. Carrying out 
our limited assurance engagement on the 
Sustainability Information included, among 
others:
•	Inquiries of employees responsible for the 
determination and consolidation as well 
as the implementation of internal control 
procedures regarding the Sustainability 
Information;
•	Inspection of selected internal and external 
documents to determine whether qualitative 
and quantitative information is supported 
by sufficient evidence and presented in an 
accurate and balanced manner;
•	Assessment of the data collection, 
validation and reporting processes as well 
as the reliability of the reported data on a 
test basis and through testing of selected 
calculations;
•	Analytical assessment of the data and 
trends of the Sustainability Information 
included in the scope of the limited 
assurance engagement;
•	Considering the appropriateness of the 
carbon conversion factor calculations and 
other unit conversion factor calculations 
used by reference to widely recognised and 
established conversion factors;
•	Reading the narrative within the Report with 
regards to the Reporting Criteria, and for 
consistency with our findings; and
•	Evaluating whether Novartis’s methods for 
developing key estimates were appropriate 
and had been consistently applied.
The procedures performed in a limited 
assurance engagement vary in nature and 
timing from, and are less in extent than for, a 
reasonable assurance engagement. 
Consequently, the level of assurance 
obtained in a limited assurance engagement 
is substantially lower than the assurance that 
would have been obtained had we performed 
a reasonable assurance engagement. 
Intended Use and Distribution of our 
Report
Our report has been prepared for Novartis 
solely in accordance with the terms of our 
engagement. We have consented to the 
publication of our report within the Novartis 
in Society Integrated Report for the purpose 
of Novartis showing that it has obtained an 
independent assurance report in connection 
with the Sustainability Information.
Our report was designed to meet the agreed 
requirements of Novartis determined by 
Novartis’s needs at the time. Our report 
should not therefore be regarded as suitable 
to be used or relied on by any party wishing 
to acquire rights against us other than 
Novartis for any purpose or in any context. 
Any party other than Novartis who obtains 
access to our report or a copy and chooses 
to rely on our report (or any part of it) will do 
so at its own risk. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, KPMG AG will accept no 
responsibility or liability in respect of our 
report to any other party.

I
Chair’s letter
In our first full-year as a pure-play medicines company, 
Novartis delivered strong results, with double-digit 
growth in sales and net profit in 2024. The performance 
validates our strategy and gives us confidence that we 
are well prepared to grow by focusing on our key thera-
peutic areas and technology platforms.
The strategic shift from a diversified life sciences com-
pany to a focused medicines organization over the last 
decade has proven to be the right path forward. With the 
divestment of our non-core activities in animal health, 
vaccines and generics, among others, we were able to 
free up resources and strengthen our position in 
fast-growing and highly innovative medical fields such as 
xRNA, radioligand therapy and gene and cell therapy.
Our recent breakthroughs in breast cancer and kidney 
and blood diseases demonstrate that our operational 
focus strengthens our ability to deliver high-value 
medicines that alleviate society’s greatest disease bur-
dens. As we continue to accelerate our research and 
development efforts and strengthen our commercial 
capabilities, we expect to continue to grow profitably in 
the long-term and create sustainable shareholder value.
Our efforts to more efficiently align our Research, Devel-
opment and Commercial organizations advanced further. 
Besides strategic acquisitions to increase our techno-
logical capacity and broaden our pipeline, we integrated 
artificial intelligence more deeply into our day-to-day 
operations to more efficiently assess new molecules and 
accelerate drug development timelines.
In view of continuing geopolitical and economic volatility, 
we are further strengthening our global production and 
distribution network to withstand potential supply chain 
disruptions and improve overall resilience. We will stay 
disciplined in managing our technical and data infrastruc-
ture as well as our partner networks and build an agile 
footprint to quickly adapt to the changing environment.
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters 
remained high on our agenda. We deepened our com-
mitment to vital topics: improving access to medicines, 
taking further measures in our fight against climate 
change and strengthening our ethics framework, among 
other things. Our efforts have been recognized by lead-
ing independent agencies and are reflected in consis-
tently high rankings.
During my 12-year tenure as Chair, my priorities were, 
among others, to focus the company on its core pharma-
ceutical expertise, improve its governance, appoint 
strong executive leadership and help create a highly ver-
satile Board of Directors to navigate the increasingly 
complex healthcare landscape. With Dr. Giovanni Cafo-
rio, who after shareholder approval is scheduled to join 
the Board as Non-Executive Chair in April 2025, Novartis 
has secured an outstanding leader to guide the company 
through its next phase.
I thank you for the confidence you have placed in our 
company and am pleased to be able to propose a divi-
dend increase of 6% to CHF 3.50 at the next Annual Gen-
eral Meeting.
Sincerely,
 
Joerg Reinhardt
Chair of the Board of Directors

CEO’s letter
2024 was a year of impact at Novartis. We reached nearly 
300 million patients with our innovative therapies — more 
than ever before — as we built on the momentum from our 
successful transformation. We consistently delivered 
strong financial and operational performance, significant 
R&D achievements, and sustainable growth, and are well 
positioned to increase value for shareholders and soci-
ety moving forward. 
Core to our approach is a relentless focus on innovation. 
It allowed us to develop and expand access to new treat-
ments in our key therapeutic areas and technology plat-
forms.
In oncology, we built on the legacy of our work in areas like 
breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia with Kisqali 
and Scemblix, medicines developed by researchers in 
Novartis labs — a testament to the strength of our R&D 
engine. We secured our spot as a global leader in radioli-
gand therapy (RLT), a platform we believe has the potential 
to transform cancer care. Pluvicto, our RLT therapy for 
advanced prostate cancer, showed strength in the US and 
Europe. We are exploring new referral pathways and 
investing in RLT manufacturing to broaden its global avail-
ability.  
Our investments in cutting edge techno­logy fueled inno-
vation across therapeutic areas. We continue to prioritize 
platforms like RLT and RNA therapeutics, and increas-
ingly integrate artificial intelligence and data science 
throughout our R&D activities. These tools are helping 
uncover potential ways to accelerate drug design and clin-
ical trial processes.  
Through a combination of in-house R&D and targeted 
acquisitions and licensing agreements, we now have more 
than 30 potential new high-value medicines in our pipe-
line and expect more than 15 submission-enabling read-
outs over the next two years.   
We remain committed to environmental, social and gov-
ernance (ESG) matters. We rank highly among industry 
peers in a range of key ESG ratings, and were honored to 
rank number one in the 2024 Access to Medicine Index.
Fostering a culture of innovation depends on people. We aim 
to recruit, retain, and cultivate the best talent in the world. 
It’s why we’ve rebuilt our organization to meet tomorrow’s 
global healthcare challenges through a simpler organization, 
targeted hiring efforts and investments in new facilities to 
serve patients around the world. 
Our approach delivered solid financial results. This past 
year saw double-digit growth in net sales and core oper-
ating income and improved core margins. Importantly, we 
delivered strong total shareholder returns for our share-
holders over recent years. 
Looking ahead, I’m confident we’ll see sales growth aver-
age at least 5% annually over the five years to 2029, and 
reach 40% core operating income margin by 2027.1
We’re proud of our record and excited about the future. I 
want to offer a special note of thanks to outgoing Board 
Chair Joerg Reinhardt, who steps down after decades of 
leadership at Novartis. His impact will carry forward, and 
I’m grateful for his years of mentorship.
In recent years, we’ve narrowed our focus, expanded our 
reach, and invested in the future. The result is a strong 
portfolio of innovative therapies that sets us up for sus-
tained growth and finds new ways to improve and extend 
patients’ lives. 
Thank you for making that possible. We look forward to 
continuing our momentum in 2025.
Sincerely,
 
Vas Narasimhan
Chief Executive Officer

Our business faces significant risks and uncertainties. 
You should carefully consider all of the information set

factors, before deciding to invest in or to maintain an 
investment in any Novartis securities. Our business, as 
well as our reputation, financial condition, results of oper‑
ations, and share price, could be materially adversely 
affected by any of these risks, as well as other risks and 
uncertainties not currently known to us or not currently 
considered material.
Strategic risks
Pricing, reimbursement and access
Risk description
Pricing and reimbursement pressure, including pricing 
transparency and access to healthcare
Context and potential impact 
Our business has continuously experienced significant 
pressures on the pricing of our products and on our abil‑
ity to obtain and maintain satisfactory rates of reimburse‑
ment for our products from governments, insurers and 
other payers. These pressures have many sources, 
including growth of healthcare costs as a percentage of 
gross domestic product; funding restrictions and policy 
changes; and public controversies, political debate, 
investigations and legal proceedings regarding pharma‑
ceutical pricing. Pressures on pricing may negatively 
impact both our product pricing and the availability of 
our products. 
In addition, we face numerous cost‑containment 
measures imposed by governments and other payers. 
These include government‑imposed, industrywide price 
reductions, mandatory pricing systems, reference pric‑
ing systems, payers limiting access to treatments based 
on cost‑benefit analyses, the importation of drugs from 
lower‑cost countries to higher‑cost countries, the shift‑
ing of the payment burden to patients through higher 
co‑payments and co-pay accumulator programs, the lim‑
iting of physicians’ ability to choose among competing 
medicines, the mandatory substitution of generic drugs 
for the patented equivalent, pressure on physicians to 
reduce the prescribing of patented prescription 
medicines, increasing pressure on intellectual property 
protections, and growing requirements for increased 
transparency on pricing. For more information on price 
controls, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—Item 
4.B Business overview—Price controls.” 
Recent macroeconomic and geopolitical trends may 
have an impact on the likelihood of these pricing and 
reimbursement pressures occurring. Slow economic 
growth and the onset and expansion of war in certain 
parts of the world (which has contributed to challenges 
such as high energy costs and inflation) have led to 
increased strain on fiscal budgets in many major econ‑
omies. In addition, legislative developments such as 
those in the US (e.g., the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA) 
and in Europe (e.g., the EU Joint Health Technology 
Assessment and 2023 EU Pharmaceutical Legislation 
Update) pose potential further pressures on pricing and 
timelines for reimbursement in these countries as legis‑
lators seek to reduce growth in healthcare spending. 
These external factors may materially affect our ability 
to protect value-based prices to achieve and maintain 
an acceptable return on our investments in the research 
and development of our products; and may impact our 
ability to research and develop new products. For exam‑
ple, in August 2024, we acceded to a “maximum fair 
price” under the US IRA for our cardiovascular drug 
Entresto for 2026 to avoid fines or the removal of all our 
products from both Medicare and Medicaid. Other prod‑
ucts of ours may be selected for the Medicare Drug Price 
Negotiation Program in the US or other price negotiation 
programs in the future.

Key products and commercial priorities
Risk description 
Failure to deliver key commercial priorities and success‑
fully launch new products
Context and potential impact 
Our ability to maintain and grow our business and to 
replace revenue and income lost to generic, biosimilar 
and other competition depends heavily on the commer‑
cial success of our new or existing key products. The 
commercial success of these products could be impacted 
at any time by a number of factors, including pressure 
from new or existing competitive products, changes in 
the prescribing habits of healthcare professionals, 
slower than expected post-launch adoption, unexpected 
side effects or safety signals, supply chain issues or 
other product shortages, pricing pressure, regulatory 
proceedings, changes in labeling, loss of intellectual 
property protection, and global pandemics. In addition, 
our revenue and margins could be significantly impacted 
by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of new 
products. 
We operate in competitive and rapidly changing mar‑
kets and could be adversely affected if we fail to keep 
pace with technological changes. Healthcare profes‑
sionals, patients and payers may choose competitor 
products instead of ours for various reasons, including 
if they perceive them to be better in terms of efficacy, 
safety, cost, convenience or other reasons. The com‑
mercial success of our key products and launches in the 
face of increasing competition requires significant atten‑
tion, management focus and resource allocation. Such 
competition could significantly affect the revenue from 
our products and our results of operations. This impact 
could also be compounded to the extent that such com‑
petition results in us making significant additional invest‑
ments in research and development, marketing or sales. 
The continual development and usage of advanced tech‑
nologies for new products and product enhancements 
is an important way in which we deliver our key commer‑
cial priorities and remain competitive. If we fail to keep 
pace with technological changes in our industry, includ‑
ing through the use of new and disruptive technologies 
such as artificial intelligence (AI), we may experience 
lower revenues and lower margins.
Furthermore, from time to time, we reassess how our 
business is organized to help ensure that we have the 
optimal structure with which to execute our strategy. An 
inability to successfully implement new organizational 
structures and operating models could have a material 
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial 
condition.
Research and development
Risk description
Failure to competitively discover and develop innovative 
medicines in our core therapeutic areas and leveraging 
our technology platforms 
Context and potential impact
We engage in extensive and costly research and devel‑
opment activities, both through our own internal 
resources and through collaborations with third parties, 
in an effort to identify and develop new products and 
new indications for existing products that address unmet, 
ever-changing medical needs, while ensuring commer‑
cial viability and success. Our ability to grow our busi‑
ness and our product pipeline; to replace sales lost due 
to branded competition, entry of generics, or other rea‑
sons; and to bring products to market that take advan‑
tage of new and potentially disruptive technologies, 
including cell, gene and radioligand therapies, depends 
in significant part on the success of these efforts. 
Failure to successfully develop our pipeline products 
is typically the result of the inherent uncertainty of sci‑
ence, suboptimal internal execution, or both. Key ele‑
ments of internal execution include our ability to priori‑
tize our investments in our highest potential value assets, 
optimize the transition of assets from research to devel‑
opment, integrate externally acquired assets in an effi‑
cient way, and execute the steps in our drug develop‑
ment process that enable our assets to be approved and 
reimbursed in a timely manner to positively impact clin‑
ical practice. We invest in new businesses, products, ser‑
vices and technologies, including AI, to achieve our goals, 
operate our business and reduce the time, effort and 
expense associated with identifying, developing and 
commercializing new products. Our investments in new 
technologies may not ultimately achieve the intended 
benefits, may not result in an adequate return of capital 
and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur unantici‑
pated liabilities. Further, a failure to successfully imple‑
ment AI as part of our R&D strategy may put us at a com‑
petitive disadvantage and impact our productivity and 
pipeline value. For more information, see also “Item 4. 
Information on the Company—Item 4.B Business over‑
view—Research and development.” 
Our new products must undergo intensive preclinical 
and clinical testing and are approved by means of a highly 
complex, lengthy, and expensive approval process that 
varies substantially from country to country and may 
have specific requirements for the recruitment of patients 
for clinical trials. Additionally, if we fail to successfully 
progress late-stage assets and the core elements of 
drug development for key programs, this could have a 
negative impact on the development of our product pipe‑
line, and ultimately on the success of our business and 
our financial results.
We may be unable to develop the necessary clinical 
evidence to support the desired indications and product 
profile for a particular disease that is needed to drive 
clinical adoption of our new products, and thereby 
achieve the full potential of our assets (also known as 
the “target product profile”). It is increasingly challeng‑
ing to adequately recruit a sufficient number of patients 
in the US for clinical trials due to the cost and effort asso‑
ciated with expanding our operations for the recruitment 
of patients into such trials. Similarly, the post‑approval 
regulatory burden has also increased, and may continue 
to increase, as regulators are increasingly focused on 
long-term data. These requirements make the mainte‑
nance of regulatory approvals and label expansions for 
our products increasingly expensive, and further heighten 
the risk of recalls, product withdrawals, changes to prod‑
uct specifications, loss of market share, and loss of rev‑
enue and profitability.


### Page 14 ###

Item 3.  Key Information
﻿
10
The clinical testing, regulatory processes and 
post-approval activities described above have become, 
and may in the future continue to become, more difficult 
during pandemics and periods of geopolitical and eco‑
nomic uncertainty. This is due to challenges related to 
recruiting, enrolling and treating patients in clinical trials, 
as well as ensuring the supply of trial materials. 
Furthermore, our research and development activi‑
ties must be conducted in an ethical and compliant man‑
ner. Among other things, we are concerned with patient 
safety (both pre- and post-product approval), data pri‑
vacy, current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP) require‑
ments, data integrity, the fair treatment of patients, diver‑
sity and inclusion in the recruitment of patients to clinical 
trials, and animal welfare. If we fail to properly manage 
such issues, we risk injury to third parties, damage to our 
reputation, negative financial consequences as a result 
of potential claims for damages, sanctions and fines, and 
the potential that investments in research and develop‑
ment activities may not bring the expected benefits to 
us. For a further description of the research and devel‑
opment of, and approval processes for, our products, 
see “Research and development” and “Regulation” under 
“Item 4. Information on the Company—Item 4.B Business 
overview.”
Intellectual property
Risk description
Expiry, assertion or loss of intellectual property protec‑
tion 
Context and potential impact
Many of our products are protected by intellectual prop‑
erty rights, including patents and regulatory exclusivities, 
which may provide us with exclusive rights to market 
those products for a limited time, to enable our purpose 
of reimagining medicine by sustainably financing our 
research and development. However, the strength and 
duration of those rights can vary significantly from prod‑
uct to product and from country to country, and they may 
be successfully challenged by third parties or govern‑
mental authorities.
If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual 
property protection, we may not be able to prevent third 
parties from launching generic or biosimilar versions of 
our branded products or from using our proprietary tech‑
nologies. Intellectual property protection relating to par‑
ticular compound forms, uses, formulations, or pro‑
cesses may not preclude third parties from designing 
around our rights in order to compete with our products. 
Loss of intellectual property protection and the introduc‑
tion of generic or biosimilar competition for a patented 
branded medicine in a country typically result in a signif‑
icant reduction in net sales and operating income for the 
branded product. Such competition can occur after suc‑
cessful challenges to intellectual property rights or the 
regular expiration of the patent term or other intellectual 
property rights. Such competition can also result from 
the entry of generic or biosimilar versions of another 
medicine in the same therapeutic class as one of our 
drugs or in a competing therapeutic class, from a 
Declaration of Public Interest or the compulsory licens‑
ing of our intellectual property by governmental author‑
ities, or as a result of a general weakening of intellectual 
property and governing laws in certain countries around 
the world. In addition, generic or biosimilar manufactur‑
ers may sometimes launch products “at risk” before the 
final resolution of legal proceedings concerning the 
infringement or validity of relevant patents or regulatory 
exclusivities.
We also rely in all aspects of our businesses on unpat‑
ented proprietary technology, know-how, trade secrets 
and other confidential information, which we seek to pro‑
tect through various measures, including confidentiality 
agreements with employees, licensees, third-party col‑
laborators, contractors and consultants who may have 
had access to such information. If these agreements are 
breached or our other protective measures should fail, 
we may not be able to prevent a third party from copy‑
ing or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets 
or other intellectual property without authorization, and 
our contractual or other remedies may not be adequate 
to cover our losses. Further, others may independently 
and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical 
products that circumvent our intellectual property by 
means of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.
In addition, third parties may claim that our products 
or business infringes, misappropriates or otherwise vio‑
lates patents or other intellectual property rights held by 
them. Claims of intellectual property infringement, mis‑
appropriation or other violations can be costly and 
time-consuming to resolve and may delay or prevent 
product launches. If successful, these actions may 
involve payment of future royalties or damages (includ‑
ing treble damages on US sales if we are found to have 
willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party) and 
may also involve injunctive relief requiring the removal of 
one or more dosage strengths of a product from the mar‑
ket (or removal of a therapeutic indication from the prod‑
uct’s approved labeling) for a period of time or through‑
out the life of the asserted intellectual property right. 
Such damages or such an injunction may have a mate‑
rial impact on our operating income and net sales. In any 
given year, we may experience a potentially significant 
impact on our net sales from products that have already 
lost intellectual property protection, as well as products 
that may lose protection during the year. 
A third party may also claim that our owned or 
licensed patent rights are not infringed, or are invalid or 
unenforceable in a litigation. The outcome following such 
legal assertions is unpredictable, and the loss of patent 
rights as a result of such assertions could result in the 
introduction of generic or biosimilar competition for, and 
reduction in sales of, the branded product covered by 
such patent rights. The outcome may also result in our 
inability to obtain fair value for the use of our patents, or 
to obtain an injunction preventing the unlicensed prac‑
tice of our patents. In addition, intellectual property pro‑
tection in certain jurisdictions outside the EU and US is 
weak and we face heightened risks to our intellectual 
property rights in these jurisdictions, including competi‑
tion with generic, infringing or counterfeit versions of our 
products at or after launch.

Item 3.  Key Information

Because we may have substantially reduced market‑
ing and research and development expenses related to 
products that are in their final years of exclusivity, the 
initial loss of protection for a product during a given year 
could also have an impact on our operating income for 
that year in an amount corresponding to a significant 
portion of the product’s lost sales. The magnitude of the 
impact of generic or biosimilar competition on our income 
could depend on a number of factors. These include, 
with respect to income in a given year, the time of year 
at which the generic or biosimilar competitor is launched; 
the ease or difficulty of manufacturing a competitor prod‑
uct and obtaining regulatory approval to market it; the 
number of generic or biosimilar competitor products 
approved, including whether, in the US, a single compet‑
itor is granted an exclusive marketing period; whether an 
authorized generic is launched; the geographies in which 
generic or biosimilar competitor products are approved, 
including the strength of the market for generic or bio‑
similar pharmaceutical products in such geographies, 
and the comparative profitability of branded pharmaceu‑
tical products in such geographies; and our ability to suc‑
cessfully develop and launch new products for patients 
that may also offset the income lost to generic or bio‑
similar competition. For more information on the patent 
and generic competition status of our products, see 
“Item 4. Information on the Company—Item 4.B Business 
overview—Intellectual property.”
Alliances, acquisitions and integration
Risk description
Failure to identify, execute or realize the expected ben‑
efits from our external business opportunities
Context and potential impact
As part of our strategy as a focused innovative medicines 
company, we routinely evaluate external opportunities 
that could strengthen our portfolio by acquiring and 
divesting products, entering businesses or entering into 
strategic alliances and collaborations. Additionally, stra‑
tegic deals with new technology platforms and ear‑
ly-stage companies contribute to our innovation. For 
example, in 2024, we closed the acquisitions of Morpho‑
Sys AG, Mariana Oncology and Kate Therapeutics, and 
entered into several strategic partnerships for the devel‑
opment and commercialization of innovative products 
across our core therapeutic areas. This strategy relies 
on our ability to identify strategic external business 
opportunities, which may be limited, including assessing 
the value of early-stage companies ahead of competi‑
tion, and to close transactions with third parties on mutu‑
ally acceptable terms. The market for clinical-stage 
assets and cutting-edge technology platforms within our 
core therapeutic areas is highly competitive and we may 
be unsuccessful in acquiring businesses or assets or 
entering into strategic partnerships that may comple‑
ment our existing portfolio. 
Once the key terms of a strategic transaction have 
been agreed with a third party, we may not be able to 
complete the transaction as the result of, among other 
things, disagreement on the contractual terms or nega‑
tive due diligence results. In addition, we cannot be sure 
that pre-transaction due diligence will identify all 
possible issues that might arise during and after the 
transaction. Our efforts on such transactions can also 
divert management’s attention from our existing busi‑
nesses and pursuing multiple transactions at the same 
time may impact our ability to efficiently conduct appro‑
priate levels of pre-transaction technical due diligence, 
and to consummate such transactions.
After a transaction is closed, efforts to develop and 
commercialize acquired or licensed products, to inte‑
grate the acquired business or to achieve expected syn‑
ergies may fail or may not fully meet expectations. This 
may occur due to difficulties in retaining key personnel, 
customers and suppliers; failure to obtain marketing 
approval or reimbursement within expected timeframes 
or at all; differences in corporate culture, standards, con‑
trols, processes and policies; or other factors. Transac‑
tions can also result in liabilities being incurred that were 
not known at the time of acquisition, or the creation of 
tax or accounting issues. Acquired businesses are not 
always in full compliance with legal, regulatory or Novartis 
standards, including, for example, current Good Manu‑
facturing Practices (cGMP) or cGCP standards, which 
can be costly and time-consuming to remediate. Further‑
more, our strategic alliances and collaborations with third 
parties may not achieve their intended goals and objec‑
tives within expected time frames, or at all. For more 
information about recent business acquisitions, see 
“Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 2. Significant 
acquisitions of businesses and spin-off of Sandoz busi‑
ness.”
Similarly, we cannot ensure that we will be able to 
successfully divest or spin off businesses or other assets 
that we have identified for this purpose; or that any com‑
pleted divestment or spin-off will achieve the expected 
strategic benefits, operational efficiencies or opportuni‑
ties; or that the divestment or spin-off will ultimately max‑
imize shareholder value.
Environmental, social and governance matters
Risk description
Failure to meet rapidly evolving environmental, social and 
governance expectations
Context and potential impact
Increasingly, in addition to financial results, companies 
are being scrutinized by various stakeholders for their 
performance on a variety of environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) matters, which can impact the long-
term sustainability of a company’s performance. An 
inability to successfully perform on ESG matters and to 
meet heightened and sometimes conflicting stakeholder 
expectations could result in negative impacts on our rep‑
utation, recruitment, retention, operations, financial 
results and share price.
Topics related to large societal changes such as 
social inequity, access to medicines and climate change 
are increasingly important to a wide range of our stake‑
holders. For example, a variety of organizations measure 
the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the 
results of these assessments are widely publicized. In 
addition, investments in funds that specialize in compa‑
nies that perform well in such assessments are popular, 
and major institutional investors have publicly


### Page 16 ###

emphasized the importance of such ESG measures in 
making their investment decisions. Our actions related 
to ESG topics may, in the long term, impact our opera‑
tions and ability to achieve our strategic goals, and ulti‑
mately could have a potential negative impact on the 
value of Novartis.  
We actively manage a broad range of ESG matters, 
taking into consideration their expected impact on the 
sustainability of our business over time, and the poten‑
tial impact of our business on society and the environ‑
ment. Our Sustainability & ESG Office, under guidance 
of the ESG Committee of the Executive Committee of 
Novartis, is tasked with developing our ESG strategy and 
tracking our performance against our ESG targets. Con‑
sidering the fast pace of change of external expecta‑
tions, including a range of upcoming regulations, there 
can be no certainty that we will manage such issues suc‑
cessfully, that the ESG standards we currently use to 
measure our performance against will remain the same, 
or that we will successfully meet society’s or investors’ 
expectations. Failure to meet rapidly evolving regulatory 
requirements, investor and societal expectations could 
also result in litigation or regulatory actions, which could 
have a material adverse impact on our reputation, recruit‑
ment, retention, operations, financial results, and share 
price. Additionally, partners in our value chain that we do 
not control may not comply with ESG commitments and 
goals we set for ourselves, which may have a negative 
impact on our business.
Sandoz spin-off
Risk description
We may not successfully achieve our goals related to our 
separation from Sandoz and our failure to do so may have 
an adverse impact on our business 
Context and potential impact
In 2023, we completed the separation of Sandoz, our 
generics and biosimilars division, into a new Swiss pub‑
licly traded independent company, by way of a 100% 
spin-off. In connection with the Sandoz separation, we 
entered into a separation and distribution agreement and 
various other agreements. These agreements govern the 
separation and distribution and the relationship between 
Novartis and Sandoz going forward, including with 
respect to the allocation of assets and liabilities between 
Novartis and Sandoz. The agreements also provide for 
the performance of services by each company for the 
benefit of the other company for a period of time. The 
terms, scope and/or duration of these agreements could 
negatively impact our ability to pursue other strategic 
business interests as we will have to devote resources 
and capacity to fulfill our obligations that we may prefer 
to direct elsewhere. If we or Sandoz are unable to sat‑
isfy our respective obligations under these agreements, 
we could incur losses or experience operational chal‑
lenges or difficulties. These agreements could also lead 
to disputes over the performance of obligations under 
these agreements or the allocation of our respective 
resources. For example, during the term of these agree‑
ments, we may have less flexibility to optimize our bio‑
logic manufacturing for our own products (or those of 
other third parties). In addition, pursuant to these 
agreements, we will perform technical development ser‑
vices for Sandoz, which may involve certain proprietary 
know-how. While we intend to retain the personnel 
involved in our technical research and development and 
to protect our trade secrets, provision of such services 
might create the incremental potential for the disclosure 
or misuse of such proprietary know-how, particularly in 
connection with technology transfer at the end of such 
arrangements.
Further, if the spin-off does not generally qualify as 
a tax-neutral transaction for Swiss and US federal 
income tax purposes, we, our shareholders, or both, 
could be subject to significant tax liabilities. The spin-off 
is intended to qualify for tax-neutral treatment for us and 
our shareholders for Swiss and US federal income tax 
purposes. If, however, the spin-off fails to qualify as 
tax-neutral for Swiss and US federal income tax pur‑
poses, we, our shareholders, or both, could recognize 
taxable gain with respect to the spin-off, resulting in 
Swiss and US income, withholding and capital gains tax 
consequences. In particular, if the spin-off does not qual‑
ify as tax neutral for Swiss and US federal income tax 
purposes, our shareholders who received shares of 
Sandoz in the spin-off as part of the separation would 
be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distri‑
bution equal to the fair market value of such shares. 
Operational risks
Cybersecurity and data protection
Risk description 
Cybersecurity breaches, data loss and catastrophic loss 
of IT systems
Context and potential impact
We are heavily dependent on critical, complex and inter‑
dependent information technology (IT) systems, includ‑
ing internet‑based systems to support our business pro‑
cesses. We also outsource significant parts of our IT 
infrastructure to third-party providers, including those 
who provide AI services and technology, and currently 
use these providers to perform business-critical IT ser‑
vices for us. We are therefore vulnerable to cybersecu‑
rity attacks and incidents on such networks and systems, 
whether our own or those of the third-party providers 
that we contract, and we have experienced, and may in 
the future experience, such cybersecurity threats and 
attacks. Cybersecurity threats and attacks take many 
forms, and the size, age and complexity of our IT sys‑
tems make them potentially vulnerable to external and 
internal security threats; outages; malicious intrusions 
and attacks; cybercrimes, including state-sponsored 
cybercrimes; malware; ransomware; misplaced data, lost 
data or data errors; programming or human errors; or 
other similar events. We may not be able to anticipate all 
types of security threats, and we may not be able to 
implement preventive measures effective against all such 
security threats. The risk of such threats and attacks has 
increased, in part due to the rise of AI, and as virtual and 
remote working have become more common, and sen‑
sitive data is accessed by employees working in less 
secure, home-based environments. In addition, due to


### Page 17 ###

our reliance on third-party providers, we have experi‑
enced, and may in the future experience, interruptions, 
delays or outages in IT service availability due to a vari‑
ety of factors outside of our control, including technical 
failures, natural disasters, fraud, or security attacks 
experienced by or caused by third-party providers. Inter‑
ruptions in the service provided by these third parties 
could affect our ability to perform critical tasks.
A significant information security or other event, such 
as a disruption or loss of availability of one or more of 
our IT systems, whether managed by us or a third-party 
service provider, has previously and could in the future 
negatively impact important business processes, such 
as the conduct of scientific research and clinical trials, 
the submission of data and information to health author‑
ities, our manufacturing and supply chain processes, our 
shipments to customers, our compliance with legal obli‑
gations, and communication between employees and 
with third parties. In the ordinary course of business, we 
collect, store and transmit confidential information 
(including but not limited to intellectual property, propri‑
etary business information and personal information).  IT 
issues have previously led to, and could in the future lead 
to, the compromise of trade secrets, confidential infor‑
mation or other intellectual property that could be sold 
and used by competitors to accelerate the development 
or manufacturing of competing products; the compro‑
mise of personal financial and health information; and 
the compromise of IT security data such as usernames, 
passwords and encryption keys, as well as security strat‑
egies and information about network infrastructure, 
which could allow unauthorized parties to gain access 
to additional systems or data. In addition, malfunctions 
in software or medical devices that make significant use 
of IT could lead to a risk of direct harm to patients. The 
costs related to significant security breaches or disrup‑
tions could be material and any cybersecurity insurance 
that we may have in place may not cover such expenses. 
If the information technology systems of our third-party 
providers become subject to disruptions or security 
breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against 
such third parties and we may have to expend significant 
resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and 
to develop and implement protections to prevent future 
events of this nature from occurring.
The occurrence of any of the events described above 
in the future could disrupt our business operations and 
result in enforcement actions or liability, including poten‑
tial government fines and penalties, claims for damages, 
and shareholder litigation or allegations that the public 
health, or the health of individuals, has been harmed.
Any significant events of this type could require us to 
expend significant resources beyond those we already 
invest to remediate any damage, to further modify or 
enhance our protective measures, and to enable the con‑
tinuity of our business.
Talent and external workforce management
Risk description
Inability to identify, attract, develop and retain qualified 
talent for critical roles or to effectively manage our exter‑
nal workforce could hinder our growth and result in 
increased information security, data and legal compli‑
ance risks
Context and potential impact
We rely on identifying, attracting, developing and retain‑
ing a diverse, highly skilled workforce across our busi‑
ness and functions to achieve our objectives. If we are 
unable to sustain our supply of key personnel—including 
senior members of our scientific and management 
teams, high‑quality researchers and development spe‑
cialists and skilled employees with key capabilities in key 
markets—our ability to achieve our major business objec‑
tives may be adversely affected. In addition, our brand 
and reputation could be negatively impacted.
The market for skilled talent has become increasingly 
competitive, and we anticipate this trend will persist in 
the long term. We face a challenge to attract and retain 
top talent in several areas, including biology, immunol‑
ogy, chemistry, clinical development, drug manufactur‑
ing, data, digital and IT, oncology, and advanced therapy 
platforms (i.e., gene and cell therapy, radioligand therapy 
and xRNA) and to maintain and strengthen our employer 
reputation. In addition, many pharmaceutical and bio‑
technology companies, universities and research cen‑
ters, and government entities with significant capital are 
not only competing with us to attract the same skilled 
talent but are also aggressively pursuing our experi‑
enced talent. Additionally, if the performance of our lead‑
ership and management fail to build upon our capabili‑
ties, the results could be suboptimal performance of our 
teams and misalignment with strategic goals, and could 
hinder our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified 
talent in critical roles. Furthermore, if we are unable to 
retain and engage key talent of companies that we 
acquire and integrate, we may not be able to realize the 
full value of these acquisitions. 
In recent years, we have adopted new ways of work‑
ing that include location flexibility and increasingly 
recruiting from a global pool of talent. However, the suc‑
cess of our business continues to depend on having 
employees who possess local knowledge of, and expe‑
rience in, our key markets. The external talent supply is 
especially limited in many of the geographies that are 
expected to be sources of growth for us. In the US, China 
and several other markets, the geographic mobility of 
talent is decreasing, as they find ample career opportu‑
nities available closer to home. Additionally, if we are 
unable to manage our external workforce effectively it 
could lead to suboptimal access to external capabilities, 
limited cost management, reduced engagement, 
increased IT and compliance risks, and impaired strate‑
gic decision-making.
The risks associated with the challenging talent mar‑
ket will be exacerbated if we are unable to retain and 
effectively develop employees, or to maintain an internal 
pipeline with critical skills, experiences, and leadership 
to deliver our business priorities. As a result, develop‑
ment, engagement, motivation, succession planning and 
performance rewards for our critical talent are essential 
to achieving our business priorities.

Strategic technology programs implementation
Risk description
Failure to successfully implement our IT strategy may 
disrupt our core business processes
Context and potential impact
We rely on various IT systems to operate our complex 
global business and several of our current IT systems are 
reaching the end of their useful life, which could cause 
disruptions to our operational stability. As a result, we are 
implementing several companywide IT programs to 
replace and consolidate outdated IT systems and to sim‑
plify and standardize our processes, systems and tools, 
and create a unified data marketplace. Implementation 
and operation of these new systems involves certain 
risks, including the potential for a failure of the new sys‑
tems to operate as expected; a failure to properly inte‑
grate new systems with other systems we use; delays in 
adopting and scaling new systems; potential loss of data 
or information; a failure of, or potential issues with, sys‑
tems related to our payment and procurement processes; 
compliance issues; and cost overruns and delays. Our 
inability to timely and successfully implement our IT strat‑
egy may prevent us from materializing expected business 
benefits or capitalizing on opportunities and could lead 
to business disruptions, cost inefficiencies and potential 
exposure to legal, regulatory and reputational risks as our 
internal controls could be negatively affected. Any dis‑
ruptions or malfunctions of new systems could cause crit‑
ical information to be delayed, lost, defective, corrupted, 
or rendered inadequate or inaccessible, which could neg‑
atively impact our operations, the effectiveness of our 
internal controls and financial condition.
Legal, regulatory, ethics and compliance
Risk description 
Challenges posed by evolving legal and regulatory 
requirements, innovative and disruptive technologies, 
and societal expectations regarding ethical behavior
Context and potential impact
We are subject to an extensive and complex framework 
of laws and regulations across the jurisdictions in which 
we operate.
The laws and regulations relevant to the healthcare 
industry and applicable to us are broad in scope, are sub‑
ject to change, and have evolving interpretations, which 
could require us to incur substantial costs associated 
with compliance or to alter one or more of our business 
practices. For example, we have been, are currently, and 
may in the future be, subject to various significant legal 
proceedings, such as private party litigation, government 
investigations and law enforcement actions worldwide. 
These types of matters may take various forms based 
on evolving government enforcement and private party 
litigation priorities, and could include, among other 
things, matters pertaining to: pricing; bribery and corrup‑
tion; trade regulation and embargo legislation; product 
liability; commercial disputes; employment and wrongful 
discharge; antitrust and competition; securities; govern‑
ment benefit programs; reimbursement; rebates; health‑
care fraud; sales and marketing practices; insider 
trading; occupational health and safety; environmental 
regulations; tax; cyber and data security; use of technol‑
ogies, including AI; data privacy; regulatory interactions; 
disclosure compliance; and intellectual property. Such 
matters can involve civil or criminal proceedings and can 
retroactively challenge practices previously considered 
to be legal. 
There is also a risk that governance of our medical 
and patient support activities, and of our interactions 
with governments, public officials/institutions, health‑
care professionals, healthcare organizations and patient 
organizations may be inadequate or fail, or that we may 
undertake activities based on improper or inadequate 
scientific justification.
New requirements may also be imposed on us due 
to changing government and societal expectations 
regarding the healthcare industry, and acceptable cor‑
porate behavior generally. For example, we are faced 
with laws and regulations requiring changes in how we 
do business, including with respect to disclosures con‑
cerning our interactions with healthcare professionals, 
healthcare organizations and patient organizations. 
These laws and regulations include requirements that 
we disclose payments or other transfers of value made 
to healthcare professionals and organizations, as well as 
information relating to the costs and prices for our prod‑
ucts, which represent evolving standards of acceptable 
corporate behavior. These requirements may cause us 
to incur significant costs, including substantial time and 
additional resources, that are necessary to bring our 
interactions with healthcare professionals and organiza‑
tions into compliance with these evolving standards. 
There is also an increased risk of noncompliance with 
applicable laws and regulations as we pursue new strat‑
egies and make organizational changes that may cause 
responsibilities for compliance matters to become 
unclear. An actual or alleged failure to comply with the 
law or with heightened public expectations could lead to 
substantial liabilities, fines, penalties or other losses that 
may not be covered by insurance adequately or at all.
Legal proceedings and investigations are inherently 
unpredictable, and significant judgments sometimes 
occur. Consequently, we may in the future incur judg‑
ments that could involve large payments, including the 
potential repayment of amounts allegedly obtained 
improperly, and other penalties, including treble dam‑
ages. In addition, such legal proceedings and investiga‑
tions, even if meritless, may affect our reputation, may 
create a risk of potential exclusion from government 
reimbursement programs in the US and other countries, 
and may lead to civil litigation or criminal exposure. As a 
result, we have in the past and may again in the future 
enter into major settlements of such claims without 
bringing them to final legal adjudication, despite having 
potentially significant defenses against them, to limit the 
risks they pose to our business and reputation. Such set‑
tlements may require us to pay significant sums of money 
and to enter into corporate integrity or similar agree‑
ments, which are intended to regulate company behav‑
ior for extended periods. From time to time, we may also 
initiate challenges to laws or regulations that we believe 
are illegal or unconstitutional. The result of such litiga‑
tion we may pursue is inherently uncertain and may neg‑
atively impact our business and reputation.


### Page 19 ###

15
In addition, regardless of the outcome of any legal 
proceedings, such proceedings are costly and time-con‑
suming and require significant attention from our man‑
agement and could therefore have a material adverse 
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of 
operations.
For information on significant legal matters pending 
against us, see “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 20. 
Provisions and other non‑current liabilities” and “Item 18. 
Financial Statements—Note 27. Commitments and con‑
tingent liabilities.”
External partner risk management and human 
rights
Risk description
Failure to maintain adequate governance and risk over‑
sight over external partner relationships, and failure of 
external partners to meet their contractual, regulatory 
or other obligations
Context and potential impact
We rely on external partners for the performance of cer‑
tain key business functions and services, including, 
among others, research and development, manufactur‑
ing operations and warehousing and distribution, certain 
finance functions, sales and marketing activities and data 
management. Many of our external partners do not have 
internal compliance systems or resources comparable 
to ours. As a result, our investment and efforts in relation 
to external partner management include focusing on risk 
management and the oversight of such external part‑
ners.
Our reliance on external partners poses certain risks, 
including the misappropriation of our intellectual prop‑
erty, the failure of the external partner to comply with 
our standards, including regulatory standards; societal 
expectations; environmental, anti-bribery and human 
rights standards and regulations; quality assurance 
requirements; unexpected supply disruptions; breach of 
our agreement by the external partner; and the unex‑
pected termination or nonrenewal of our agreement by 
the external partner. Any of these risks could result in 
legal claims or proceedings, liability under applicable 
laws or significant regulatory penalties, and could dis‑
rupt our operations and have a negative impact on our 
reputation.
In addition, governments require us, and the public 
may expect us, to take responsibility for and report on 
compliance with various human rights, responsible 
sourcing and environmental practices, as well as other 
actions of our external partners around the world. 
Ultimately, if external partners fail to meet their obli‑
gations to us, we may lose our investment in the relation‑
ship with the external partners or fail to receive the 
expected benefits of our agreements with such external 
partners. While we aim to identify and assess any risk of 
harm to society caused by our external partners’ opera‑
tions, should any of these external partners fail to com‑
ply with the law or our standards, or should they other‑
wise act inappropriately while performing services for us, 
we could be held responsible for their acts, our reputa‑
tion may suffer, and penalties could be imposed on us.
Manufacturing and product quality
Risk description 
Inability to ensure proper controls in product develop‑
ment and product manufacturing, and failure to comply 
with applicable regulations and standards
Context and potential impact
The development and manufacture of our products is 
complex and heavily regulated by governmental health 
authorities around the world, which may vary by country. 
Healthcare systems, healthcare providers and patients 
rely on us to meet the highest quality standards. Regard‑
less of whether our products and the related raw mate‑
rials are developed and manufactured at our own man‑
ufacturing sites or by third parties, we must ensure that 
all development, manufacturing, quality and supply pro‑
cesses comply with regulatory requirements, as well as 
our own quality standards in order to deliver novel ther‑
apies while ensuring patient safety. Failure to comply 
with regulatory requirements may result in warning let‑
ters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of products, 
injunctions, product recalls, failure to secure product 
approvals, debarment, or harm to patients or our repu‑
tation. 
In recent years, global health authorities have sub‑
stantially intensified their scrutiny of manufacturers’ 
compliance with regulatory requirements. Any significant 
failure by us or our third-party suppliers to comply with 
regulatory requirements, or with health authorities’ 
expectations, may create the need to suspend clinical 
trials, suspend manufacturing, shut down production 
facilities or production lines, and recall clinical or com‑
mercial products. Additionally, we may acquire new com‑
panies or technology platforms that may not fully com‑
ply with regulatory requirements or expectations, which 
may pose legal, financial and reputation risks for us 
post-acquisition. A failure to fully comply with regulatory 
requirements could also lead to a delay in the approval 
of new products, an inability to ship or import our prod‑
ucts, and significant penalties and reputational harm.
In addition, the technically complex manufacturing 
processes required to manufacture many of our prod‑
ucts increase the risk of both production failures and 
product recalls, and can increase the cost of producing 
our goods. Some of our products require a supply of 
highly specialized raw materials, such as cell lines, tis‑
sue samples, bacteria, viral strains and radioisotopes. In 
addition, we manufacture and sell a number of sterile 
products, biologic products and products that involve 
advanced therapy platforms, such as gene and cell ther‑
apy, radioligand therapy, and xRNA, all of which are par‑
ticularly complex and involve highly specialized manu‑
facturing technologies. For more information, see “Item 
4. Information on the Company—Item 4.B. Business over‑
view—Production.” As a result, even slight deviations at 
any point in their production processes or in the materi‑
als used have led to, and may in the future lead to, pro‑
duction failures or recalls.


### Page 20 ###

Supply chain
Risk description
Inability to maintain continuity of product supply
Context and potential impact
Many of our products are produced using technically 
complex manufacturing processes and require a supply 
of highly specialized raw materials. For some of our prod‑
ucts and raw materials, we may rely on a single source 
of supply. In addition, we manufacture and sell a number 
of sterile products, biologic products, and products that 
involve advanced therapy platforms, such as gene and 
cell therapy, radioligand therapy, and xRNA, all of which 
are particularly complex and involve highly specialized 
manufacturing technologies. Due to this complexity, 
there is a risk of production and supply of critical raw 
materials failures, which may result in supply interrup‑
tions or product recalls due to manufactured products 
not meeting required specifications.
In addition, due to the inherent complexities of our 
manufacturing processes and the supply chains for 
advanced therapy platforms, we are required to plan our 
production activities and purchase of materials well in 
advance. If we suffer from third-party raw material short‑
ages, underestimate market demand for a product, or fail 
to accurately predict when a new product will be approved 
for sale, then we may not be able to produce sufficient 
product to meet demand. These issues could be made 
worse during a pandemic, or as a result of macroeconomic 
factors or geopolitical events, such as military actions and 
wars in certain parts of the world, and could lead to a sud‑
den increase in demand for selected medicinal products, 
resulting in the short-term unavailability of critical materi‑
als; logistical and supply challenges that may lead to our 
inability to ship products from one location to another due 
to restrictions imposed; or our inability to properly oper‑
ate a manufacturing site due to restrictions imposed.
Our or our suppliers’ inability to manage such issues 
could lead to shutdowns, product shortages, or to us 
being entirely unable to supply products to patients for 
an extended period of time. Furthermore, as our prod‑
ucts are intended to promote the health of patients, such 
shortages or shutdowns could harm our reputation and 
have led to, and could continue in the future to lead to, 
significant losses of sales revenue, potential litigation or 
allegations that the public health, or the health of indi‑
viduals, has been harmed.
Data privacy
Risk description
Noncompliance with personal data protection laws and 
regulations
Context and potential impact
We operate in an industry that relies on the collection, 
processing, analysis and interpretation of large sets of 
patients’ and other individuals’ personal information, 
including via social media and mobile technologies. The 
operation of our business requires data to flow to our 
third-party contractors’ systems and across the borders 
of numerous countries in which there are different, poten‑
tially conflicting, and frequently changing, data privacy 
laws in effect. Examples of such laws include: the EU 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); Brazil’s 
General Personal Data Protection Law; the Personal 
Information Protection Law in China; and different com‑
prehensive consumer privacy laws in multiple US states. 
Such laws impose stringent requirements on how we and 
third parties with whom we contract collect, share, 
export, protect or otherwise process personal informa‑
tion, and provide for significant penalties for noncompli‑
ance. Security breaches of our systems or those of our 
third-party contractors, or other failures to protect the 
data we collect from misuse or breach by third parties, 
could expose such personal information to unauthorized 
persons which could result in legal claims or proceed‑
ings, liability under applicable data privacy laws and sig‑
nificant regulatory penalties, and which could disrupt our 
operations and have a negative impact on our reputation.
Events involving the substantial loss or unlawful 
access or disclosure of personal information, use of per‑
sonal information without a legal basis, or other privacy 
violations could give rise to significant liability, reputa‑
tional harm, damaged relationships with business part‑
ners, and potentially substantial monetary penalties and 
other sanctions under laws enacted or being enacted 
around the world. Such events could also lead to restric‑
tions on our ability to use personal information and/or 
transfer personal information across country borders, 
which could interfere with critical business operations. 
In addition, there is a trend of increasing divergence of 
data privacy legal frameworks, not only across these 
frameworks but also within individual legal frameworks 
themselves. This divergence may increase compliance 
costs, constrain the implementation of global business 
processes and may lead to different approaches on the 
use of health data for scientific research, which may have 
a negative impact on our business and operations.
Falsified medicines
Risk description
Impact of falsified medicines on patient safety, and rep‑
utational and financial harm to us and our products
Context and potential impact	
We continue to be challenged by the vulnerability of dis‑
tribution channels to falsified medicines, which, as 
defined by the World Health Organization, include coun‑
terfeit, stolen, tampered and illegally diverted medicines. 
Falsified medicines pose patient safety risks and can 
be seriously harmful or life-threatening. Reports of 
adverse events related to falsified medicines and 
increased levels of falsified medicines in the healthcare 
system affect patient confidence in genuine medicines 
and in healthcare systems in general. These events could 
also cause us substantial reputational and financial harm, 
and potentially lead to litigation if the adverse event from 
a falsified medicine is mistakenly attributed to our prod‑
ucts. Stolen or illegally diverted medicines that are not 
properly stored and are later sold through unauthorized 
channels could adversely impact patient safety, our rep‑
utation and our business. Furthermore, there is a direct 
financial loss when falsified medicines replace sales of 
our products, or our products are recalled following the 
discovery of falsified products.

Emerging risks
Geopolitical developments
Risk description
Impact of geo- and socio-political threats
Context and potential impact 
Geopolitical and social tensions and conflicts, such as 
government shutdowns, changes in government admin‑
istrations, sovereign risks, acts of war or aggression and 
terrorist activities, have both a direct and indirect impact 
on the pharmaceutical industry and our operations. As 
a result of such tensions conflicts, certain countries have 
adopted or may in the future adopt additional, protec‑
tionist measures including the imposition of tariffs. Tar‑
iffs that are intended to shield domestic markets from 
foreign competition and the possibility of additional trade 
restrictions, such as export controls, could have a mate‑
rial impact on our business. If tariffs or export controls 
on pharmaceutical products or active pharmaceutical 
ingredients (APIs) were increased in certain parts of the 
world, our supply chain and flow of our products could 
be immediately disrupted. There is also an additional risk 
that aggressive monetary and fiscal policies by govern‑
ments and central banks to curb inflation may prompt 
market-specific recessions and raise the cost-of-living, 
further putting pressure on pricing and cost containment 
for the pharmaceutical industry.
Collectively, unstable geo- and socio-political condi‑
tions could, among other things, disturb the international 
flow of goods and increase the costs and difficulties of 
international transactions. This could potentially impact 
our ability to develop and supply our products to patients 
in an undisrupted fashion, and further erode reimburse‑
ment mechanisms for our medicines.
Macroeconomic developments
Risk description
Impact of macroeconomic developments
Context and potential impact
Our business may be impacted by deteriorating macro‑
economic and financial conditions directly affecting us, 
our suppliers, payers and consumers. Given that patients, 
in many countries, directly pay a sizable and increasing 
portion of their own healthcare costs, there is a risk that 
patients may cut back on prescription drugs due to finan‑
cial constraints. 
Negative macroeconomic developments may also 
adversely affect the ability of payers, as well as our dis‑
tributors, customers, suppliers, and service providers, to 
pay for our products or to buy necessary inventory or 
raw materials, and to perform their obligations under 
agreements with us. Weakening growth, unstable mar‑
ket conditions and rising debt service costs may also 
increase the credit risk of our counterparties. Although 
we make efforts to monitor the financial condition and 
liquidity of these third parties, our ability to do so is lim‑
ited, and some of them may become unable to fulfill their 
obligations in a timely manner or may even become insol‑
vent. These risks may be elevated with respect to our 
interactions with fiscally challenged government payers, 
or with third parties with substantial exposure to such 
payers.
At the same time, significant changes, and potential 
future volatility in financial markets, the consumer and 
business environment, the competitive landscape, and 
the global political and security landscape make it 
increasingly difficult for us to predict our revenues and 
earnings, which may impact the success of our mid- and 
long-term planning.
Asset price corrections in financial markets may also 
result in lower returns on our financial investments. In 
addition, pricing pressures in developed markets result‑
ing from efforts to reduce the cost of healthcare (e.g., 
the US IRA, which targets drug prices) may have a neg‑
ative impact on our revenue and our net sales. In addi‑
tion, inflation may have an impact on our operating costs 
in the form of higher prices for supplies, energy, raw 
materials, wages, and capital, which could reduce our 
net income.
Uncertainties around future central bank and other 
economic policies in the US and EU, including elevated 
interest rates, government shutdowns, debt ceilings or 
government funding, could also impact world trade. Sud‑
den increases in economic, currency or financial market 
volatility in different countries, such as appreciation of 
the US dollar, have also impacted, and may continue to 
have an unpredictable impact on our business, or results 
of operations, including the conversion of our operating 
results into our reporting currency, the US dollar, as well 
as the value of our investments in our pension plans.

trols on our business, see “Item 4. Information on the

Climate change
Risk description
Failure to manage physical and transition risks from cli‑
mate change 
Context and potential impact
We are exposed to a broad range of climate risks such 
as transition risks (e.g., regulatory frameworks, carbon 
pricing, and the cost of and access to capital) and phys‑
ical risks (e.g., heat, water scarcity, rising sea levels, and 
flooding from severe weather events), which could vary 
in magnitude and impact across different countries. 
Climate change has triggered, and may continue to 
trigger, the adoption of new regulatory requirements 
across the globe, such as in Switzerland, the EU, the 
United Kingdom, or Australia, as well as rapidly evolving 
societal expectations. As a result, we may be required 
to increase our investment in technology to reduce our 
energy use, water use and greenhouse gas emissions. 
In addition, legislative and regulatory action, both current 
and in the future, includes or could include, carbon

pricing, climate risk-related disclosures, and changes in 
zoning or building codes to increase climate resilience. 
As a result, the combined impact of these transition risks 
could increase our direct operating costs or be passed 
on to us through the impact on our supply chain. Further, 
any failure to achieve climate-related commitments we 
have made in the past, or that we make in the future, in 
the expected timeframe, or at all, could result in nega‑
tive impacts on our reputation, our operations, and the 
price of our shares.
Climate change has created, and will continue to cre‑
ate, physical risks to our business and our supply chain. 
Some of our production facilities and supplier locations 
that depend on the availability of significant water sup‑
plies are located in areas where fresh water is increas‑
ingly scarce. Other facilities and suppliers are located in 
areas that, due to increasingly violent weather events, 
rising sea levels, or both, are increasingly at risk of sub‑
stantial damage. In regions where such a risk is present, 
this has an impact not only on our own operations but 
also our distributed supply chain. Such events may result 
in the loss of life, increased costs, business interruptions, 
destruction of facilities, and disruption to healthcare sys‑
tems that patients use to access our medicines.
Tax laws and developments
Risk description
Changes in tax laws or their application
Context and potential impact
Our multinational operations are taxed under the laws 
of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we oper‑
ate. Changes in tax laws or in their application could lead 
to an increased risk of international tax disputes and an 
increase in our effective tax rate, which could adversely 
affect our financial results. The integrated nature of our 
worldwide operations can produce conflicting claims 
from tax authorities in different countries as to the prof‑
its to be taxed in the individual countries, including poten‑
tial disputes relating to the prices our subsidiaries charge 
one another for intercompany transactions, known as 
transfer pricing. Most of the jurisdictions in which we 
operate have double tax treaties with other foreign juris‑
dictions, which provide a framework for mitigating the 
impact of double taxation on our revenues and capital 
gains. However, mechanisms developed to resolve such 
conflicting claims are largely untried and can be expected 
to be very lengthy. Accruals for tax contingencies are 
made based on experience, interpretations of tax law, 
and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities. 
However, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the 
ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in pay‑
ments materially different from the amounts accrued.
In 2019, the Organization for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) launched a new initiative on 
behalf of the G20 to minimize profit shifting by working 
toward a global tax framework that ensures that corpo‑
rate income taxes are paid where consumption takes 
place, in addition to introducing a global standard on min‑
imum taxation combined with new tax dispute resolution 
processes. This project achieved OECD political con‑
sensus in October 2021, and the detailed principles are 
still under discussion by the OECD and political leaders. 
The implementation of certain of these new OECD prin‑
ciples began in 2024 in certain countries, including Swit‑
zerland. However, some countries already announced 
postponement to 2025 while others have not taken any 
implementation steps so far. Once changes to the tax 
laws in any jurisdiction in which we operate are enacted 
or substantially enacted, we will be subject to the OECD 
minimum tax regime, the aim of which is to bring the total 
amount of taxes paid on our profit in a given jurisdiction 
up to a minimum rate of 15%. In June 2023, the Swiss 
public voted to approve an amendment to the Swiss Con‑
stitution that provides the legal basis for the implemen‑
tation of an OECD compliant minimum tax in Switzerland. 
In December 2023, the Swiss Federal Council partially 
implemented the OECD 15% minimum tax for the finan‑
cial year 2024 in the form of a qualified domestic top-up 
tax (QDMTT), which will be assessed on certain qualify‑
ing profits earned by companies domiciled in Switzer‑
land. This QDMTT will not be applied to qualifying prof‑
its earned by a company’s affiliates domiciled in tax 
jurisdictions outside of Switzerland. In September 2024, 
the Swiss Federal Council announced implementation 
of the income inclusion rule in 2025 as a next step to fur‑
ther align with the new OECD global agreed standards. 
The timing and specific provisions of any further tax reg‑
ulations remain subject to assessments in political and 
technical forums at both a federal and cantonal level.  
Due to the ongoing discussion in many countries on 
the implementation and additional guidance from the 
OECD, the full impact of the OECD minimum tax project 
on our financial position, income statement and cash 
flows in the longer term cannot currently be estimated 
as the OECD continues to issue additional guidance 
aimed at providing more clarity on the application of the 
new global standards.
On September 12, 2023, the EU Commission pub‑
lished two draft directives relating to international tax. 
The draft Business in Europe: Framework for Income 
Taxation (BEFIT) directive provides common rules for 
determining the corporate tax base for EU-based enti‑
ties that are part of a group with global consolidated rev‑
enues above EUR 750 million. The BEFIT proposal 
includes provisions for a formula-driven allocation of 
profits between relevant EU member states which would 
then be subject to the corporate income tax rate of the 
respective member state. The draft transfer pricing 
directive aims to harmonize transfer pricing rules within 
the EU consistent with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guide‑
lines. It also clarifies processes for relieving double tax‑
ation within the EU. Both draft directives require unani‑
mous agreement among EU member states before they 
can be further implemented. In the US, the IRA was 
signed into law on August 16, 2022. The IRA creates a 
15% corporate alternative minimum tax on the profits of 
corporations whose average annual adjusted financial 
statement income exceeds USD 1.0 billion. The IRA also 
includes a one percent excise tax on certain corporate 
stock repurchases. Additionally, the IRA also contains 
provisions that affect tax-exempt entities, including tax 
credit opportunities to encourage investment in clean 
energy and expanded incentives for energy-efficient 
construction by tax-exempt entities.

While we have taken steps to comply with the evolv‑
ing tax initiatives of the OECD, the US and the EU, and 
we will continue to do so, significant uncertainties remain 
as to the outcome of our efforts.

ments—Note 6. Income taxes” and “Item 18. Financial 
Statements—Note 12. Deferred tax assets and liabilities.”
General risks
Indebtedness
Risk description
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our operations
Context and potential impact
As of December 31, 2024, we had USD 21.4 billion of 
non‑current financial debt, and USD 8.2 billion of current 
financial debt. Our current and long‑term debt requires 
us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to service inter‑
est and principal payments and, if interest rates rise, this 
amount may increase. As a result, our existing debt may 
limit our ability to use our cash flow to fund capital expen‑
ditures, to engage in transactions, or to meet other cap‑
ital needs, or otherwise may place us at a competitive 
disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt. 
Our debt could also limit our flexibility to plan for and 
react to changes in our business or industry, and increase 
our vulnerability to general adverse economic and indus‑
try conditions, including changes in interest rates or a 
downturn in our business or the economy. We may also 
have difficulty refinancing our existing debt or incurring 
new debt on terms that we would consider to be com‑
mercially reasonable, if at all.
Goodwill and intangible assets
Risk description
Goodwill and intangible assets resulting in significant 
impairment charges
Context and potential impact
We carry a significant amount of goodwill and other 
intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet, 
including, in particular, substantial goodwill and other 
intangible assets obtained through acquisitions, includ‑
ing most recently through our acquisitions of Chinook 
Therapeutics, MorphoSys AG,  Mariana Oncology and 
Kate Therapeutics. As a result, we have incurred, and 
may in the future incur further, significant impairment 
charges if the fair value of the intangible assets and the 
groupings of cash-generating units containing goodwill 
would be less than their carrying value on our consoli‑
dated balance sheet at any point in time.
We regularly review our intangible and tangible assets 
for impairment, including identifiable intangible assets 
and goodwill. If one or more events occur that would 
cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used 
in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangi‑
ble assets, such revision could result in an impairment 
charge in the period in which it occurs. Any significant 
impairment charges could have a material adverse effect 
on our results of operations and financial condition. In 
2024, for example, we recorded goodwill and intangible 
asset impairment charges of USD 1.4 billion.
For a detailed discussion about how we determine 
whether an impairment has occurred, what factors could 
result in an impairment, and the impact of impairment 
charges on our results of operations, see Item 18. Finan‑
cial Statements—Note 1. Accounting policies” and “Item 
18. Financial Statements—Note 11. Goodwill and intangi‑
ble assets other than goodwill.”
Foreign currency exchange rates
Risk description
Negative effect on financial results due to foreign cur‑
rency exchange rate fluctuations
Context and potential impact
Changes in exchange rates between the US dollar, which 
is our reporting currency, and other currencies has pre‑
viously resulted in, and in the future may result in signif‑
icant increases or decreases in our reported sales, costs 
and earnings as expressed in US dollars, and in the 
reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows.
In addition to ordinary market risk, there is a risk that 
countries could take affirmative steps that could signifi‑
cantly impact the value of their currencies. Such steps 
could include unconventional monetary policies, tariffs 
and potential withdrawals by countries from common 
currencies. In addition, countries facing local financial 
difficulties, including countries experiencing high infla‑
tion rates, and highly indebted countries facing large cap‑
ital outflows, may impose controls on the exchange of 
foreign currency. Currency exchange controls and sanc‑
tions could limit our ability to distribute retained earnings 
from our local affiliates, or to pay intercompany payables 
due from those countries.
Despite measures undertaken to reduce or hedge 
against foreign currency exchange risks, as a significant 
portion of our earnings and expenditures are in curren‑
cies other than the US dollar, including expenditures in 
Swiss francs that are significantly higher than our reve‑
nue in Swiss francs, any such exchange rate volatility 
may negatively and materially impact our results of oper‑
ations and financial condition, and may impact the 
reported value of our net sales, earnings, assets and lia‑
bilities. In addition, the timing and extent of such volatil‑
ity can be difficult to predict. Furthermore, depending on 
the movements of particular foreign exchange rates, we 
may be materially adversely affected at a time when the 
same currency movements are benefiting some of our 
competitors.
For more information on the effects of currency fluc‑
tuations on our consolidated financial statements and 
on how we manage currency risk, see “Item 5. Operat‑
ing and Financial Review and Prospects—Item 5.B Liquid‑
ity and capital resources—Effects of currency fluctua‑
tions” and “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 28. 
Financial instruments – additional disclosures.”

Key customers
Risk description
Concentration among our key customers
Context and potential impact 
A significant portion of our global sales is made to a rel‑
atively small number of drug wholesalers, retail chains 
and other purchasing organizations. For example, our 
three most important customers globally accounted for 
approximately 17%, 13% and 7%, respectively, of net 
sales from continuing operations in 2024. The largest 
trade receivables outstanding were for these three cus‑
tomers, amounting to 19%, 12% and 7%, respectively, of 
the trade receivables at December 31, 2024. Historically, 
there has been a trend of consolidation among our cus‑
tomer base, which may continue in the future. As a result, 
we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk among 
our key customers. If one or more of our major custom‑
ers experienced financial difficulties, the effect on us 
would be considerable, and could include a substantial 
loss of sales and an inability to collect amounts owed to 
us.
Environmental matters
Risk description
Impact of environmental liabilities
Context and potential impact
The environmental laws of various jurisdictions impose 
actual and potential obligations on us to investigate and 
remediate contaminated sites, including in connection 
with activities in the past by businesses that are no lon‑
ger part of Novartis. In some cases, these remediation 
efforts may take many years. While we have set aside 
provisions for known worldwide environmental liabilities 
that are probable and estimable, there is no guarantee 
that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the 
amounts for which we have provided in our consolidated 
financial statements. If environmental contamination 
resulting from our facility operations, business activities 
or products adversely impacts third parties or if we fail 
to properly manage the safety of our facilities, including 
the safety of our employees and contractors, and the 
environmental risks, we may face substantial one-time 
and recurring costs and other penalties, and be required 
to increase our provisions for environmental liabilities.
Furthermore, our headquarters and a number of our 
major production and research facilities are located near 
earthquake fault lines in Basel, Switzerland. Other major 
facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines in 
various locations around the world. A major earthquake 
could result in loss of life, business interruptions and the 
destruction of our facilities. See also “Item 4. Information 
on the Company—Item 4.D Property, plants and equip‑
ment” and “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 20. Pro‑
visions and other non‑current liabilities.”
Pension plans
Risk description
Inaccuracies in the assumptions and estimates used to 
calculate our pension plan and other post-employment 
obligations
Context and potential impact
We sponsor pension and other post-employment bene‑
fit plans in various forms that cover a significant portion 
of our current and former employees. For post-employ‑
ment plans with defined benefit obligations, we are 
required to make significant assumptions and estimates 
about future events in calculating the expense and the 
present value of the liability related to these plans. These 
include assumptions about the discount rates we apply 
to estimate future defined benefit obligations and net 
periodic pension expense, as well as rates of future pen‑
sion increases. In addition, our actuarial consultants pro‑
vide our management with historical statistical informa‑
tion, such as withdrawal and mortality rates in connection 
with these estimates. 
Assumptions and estimates that we use may differ 
materially from the actual results we experience due to 
changing market and economic conditions, higher or 
lower withdrawal rates, and longer or shorter life spans 
of participants, among other factors. Depending on 
events, such differences could have a material effect on 
our total equity, and may require us to make additional 
contributions to our pension funds.
For more information on obligations under retirement 
and other post-employment benefit plans and underly‑
ing actuarial assumptions, see “Item 18. Financial State‑
ments—Note 24. Post-employment benefits for employ‑
ees.”

4.B Business overview
Overview
Novartis is an innovative medicines company, engaged 
in the research, development, manufacturing, distribu‑
tion, marketing and sale of a broad range of innovative 
pharmaceutical medicines. Our purpose is to reimagine 
medicine to improve and extend people’s lives by lever‑
aging our scientific expertise to find new ways to treat 
and cure disease. Our strategy is to focus on high-value, 
innovative medicines that alleviate society’s greatest dis‑
ease burdens through technology leadership in R&D and 
novel access approaches. To support our strategy, we 
have clear focus areas where we commit most of our 
time, energy and resources. These core therapeutic 
areas are cardiovascular, renal and metabolic; immunol‑
ogy; neuroscience; and oncology. For more information 
about our strategy, see “Item 5. Operating and Financial 
Review and Prospects—Overview—Our strategy.” 
In 2024, Novartis achieved net sales from continuing 
operations of USD 50.3 billion, and net income from con‑
tinuing operations amounted to USD 11.9 billion. Head‑
quartered in Basel, Switzerland, we employed 75 883 
full‑time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2024. 
Our products are sold in approximately 120 countries 
around the world.
Our operations are organized into the following five 
organizational units: 
•	 Biomedical Research is our innovation engine, focused 
on creating new ways of fighting disease and turning 
scientific breakthroughs into new medicines with the 
potential to change lives.
•	 Development oversees the development of potential 
new medicines through clinical trials to confirm their 
safety and efficacy, and steers the way to regulatory 
approval for use by patients. 
•	 Operations manufactures and delivers our medicines 
to customers, while also overseeing the global func‑
tions of IT, procurement and real estate services.  
•	 The two commercial units, US and International, focus 
on their respective geographic areas. They work with 
customers to provide innovative medicines and ser‑
vices that improve treatment options and raise the qual‑
ity of care for patients. 
These organizational units are supported by our global 
functions in areas such as corporate affairs, ethics, risk 
and compliance, finance, legal, internal audit, people and 
organization and strategy and growth. For more infor‑
mation about our Development unit, see “—Research and 
development—Development program” below. For more

Key marketed products
The following summaries describe certain Novartis key 
marketed products in certain indications. These prod‑
ucts are listed according to year-end net sales. Some of 
them have lost patent protection or are otherwise sub‑
ject to generic competition, while others are subject to 
patent challenges by potential generic competitors (see 
“—Intellectual property” for general information on intel‑
lectual property and regulatory data protection, and for 
more information on the status of patents and exclusiv‑
ity for certain key marketed products).
While we typically seek to sell our marketed products 
throughout the world, not all products and indications 
are available in every country. The indications described 
in these summaries may therefore vary by country. In 
addition, a product may be available under different 
brand names depending on country and indication. 
•	 Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) is an oral, first‑in‑class 
angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor. Entresto 
enhances the protective effects of a hormone system 
called the natriuretic peptide system, and simultane‑
ously suppresses the harmful effects of a hormone sys‑
tem called the renin‑angiotensin‑aldosterone system. 
It is approved:
•	 In the US, the EU and other countries to treat adults 
who have symptomatic chronic heart failure with 
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). HFrEF is a dis‑
ease in which the heart cannot pump blood efficiently 
•	 In the US and other countries to treat adult patients 
with chronic heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF). HFpEF is a disease in which the 
heart’s main pumping chamber (left ventricle) 
becomes stiff and unable to fill properly with blood
•	 In the US, the EU and other countries to treat chil‑
dren and adolescents aged 1 year and older who have 
symptomatic chronic heart failure with left ventricu‑
lar systolic dysfunction

blood pressure that is not the result of a medical con‑
dition)
•	 Cosentyx (secukinumab) is an injectable, fully human 
monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits interleu‑
kin-17A (IL‑17A), a cytokine involved in several immuno‑
logical diseases. It is approved in the US, the EU and 
other countries to treat:
•	 Adults and children aged 6 years and older with mod‑
erate‑to‑severe plaque psoriasis (this indication is 
also approved in China). Psoriasis is a debilitating 
systemic inflammatory disease that is characterized 
by the appearance of raised, red patches on the skin
•	 Adults with active non-radiographic axial spondy‑
loarthritis (nr-axSpA). nr-axSpA is a long-term inflam‑
matory disease that is characterized by chronic back 
pain and is not visible on X-rays
•	 Adults and children (aged 2 years and older in the 
US and 6 years and older in the EU) with active pso‑
riatic arthritis (PsA). PsA is a type of progressive 
inflammatory arthritis that results in swollen and pain‑
ful joints and tendons, which can cause structural 
damage to the bones and joints
•	 Adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS). AS is 
a progressive inflammatory disease that is charac‑
terized by chronic back pain, is generally visible on 
X-rays, and can cause structural damage to the 
bones and joints
•	 Children (aged 4 years and older in the US and 6 
years and older in the EU) with active enthesitis-re‑
lated arthritis (ERA) and children (aged 2 years and 
older in the US and 6 years and older in the EU) with 
active juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA). ERA and 
JPsA are subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. If 
left untreated, they can lead to high levels of pain and 
disability
•	 Adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppu‑
rativa (HS). HS is a chronic skin disease that causes 
recurring boil-like lumps that may burst into open 
wounds and cause irreversible scarring, often in the 
most intimate parts of the body
An intravenous formulation of Cosentyx is approved in 
the US for the treatment of adults with active PsA, AS 
and nr-axSpA.
•	 Kesimpta (ofatumumab) is an anti-CD20 monoclonal 
antibody that enables the targeted depletion of B-cells, 
specifically in lymph nodes. Kesimpta is the only B-cell 
treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis that is self-ad‑
ministered once-monthly via the Sensoready autoin‑
jector pen, following three weekly starter doses. It is 
approved:
•	 In the US to treat adults with relapsing forms of mul‑
tiple sclerosis, including clinically isolated syndrome, 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and active sec‑
ondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Multiple scle‑
rosis is a disease in which the immune system attacks 
the protective covering of nerves (known as myelin)
•	 In the EU to treat adults with relapsing forms of mul‑
tiple sclerosis with active disease defined by clinical 
or imaging features (i.e., relapse, disability, or lesions 
detected by MRI scans)  
Approved indications vary across other countries. Ofa‑
tumumab was originally developed by Genmab and 
licensed to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Novartis obtained 
the rights to ofatumumab from GSK across all indica‑
tions.
•	 Kisqali (ribociclib) is a selective oral cyclin‑dependent

is a rare blood cancer in which the bone marrow pro‑
duces too many red blood cells, resulting in serious 
problems like clots
•	 Patients aged 12 years and older with acute or chronic 
graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and who have had 
an inadequate response to corticosteroids or other 
systemic therapies. GvHD occurs in stem-cell trans‑
plant patients when donor cells see the recipient’s 
healthy cells as foreign and attack them
Novartis licensed ruxolitinib from Incyte Corporation 
for development and commercialization in the indica‑
tions of oncology, hematology and GvHD outside the 
US. Incyte Corporation markets ruxolitinib as Jakafi® in 
the US.

with Genentech in the US and shares a portion of oper‑
ating income, but Novartis does not record any US 
sales. Novartis records all sales of Xolair outside the 
US. 
•	 Ilaris (canakinumab) is an injectable, selective, high-af‑
finity, fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits 
interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), a key cytokine in the 
inflammatory pathway. It is approved in the US, the EU 
and other countries to treat patients with certain debil‑
itating rare autoinflammatory disorders, including:
•	 Adults and children with periodic fever syndromes. 
Periodic fever syndromes are a set of rare disorders 
characterized by recurrent episodes of illness, with 
fever as the main symptom
•	 Patients with Still’s disease, including systemic juve‑
nile idiopathic arthritis and adult-onset Still’s disease. 
Still’s disease is a disorder that causes fevers, rash 
and joint pain
•	 Adults with acute gouty arthritis (a non-rare indica‑
tion). Gouty arthritis is a type of arthritis character‑
ized by pain, redness, tenderness and swelling in one 
or more joints
Approved indications vary by country.
•	 Pluvicto (lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan) is an 
intravenous radioligand therapy combining a targeting 
compound (a ligand) with a therapeutic radionuclide (a 
radioactive particle, in this case lutetium-177). Pluvicto 
delivers beta radiation selectively to PSMA-positive 
cells and the surrounding cells while minimizing off-tar‑
get effects. It is approved in the US, the EU and other 
countries to treat:
•	 Adults with prostate-specific membrane anti‑
gen-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (PSMA-positive mCRPC), a type of advanced 
cancer that has spread to other parts of the body 
(metastatic). These patients have already been 
treated with other anticancer treatments (androgen 
receptor pathway inhibition and taxane-based che‑
motherapy)
•	 Sandostatin SC (octreotide acetate for injection) and 
Sandostatin LAR (octreotide acetate for injectable sus‑
pension) are somatostatin analogs approved in the US, 
the EU and other countries to treat:
•	 Adults with acromegaly that is inadequately con‑
trolled by surgery or radiotherapy. Acromegaly is a 
chronic disease caused by the oversecretion of 
growth hormone
•	 Patients with certain symptoms associated with car‑
cinoid tumors and other types of functional gastro‑
intestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
Sandostatin LAR is also approved in the EU and other 
countries to treat patients with advanced neuroendo‑
crine tumors of the midgut or of unknown primary 
tumor origin. 
•	 Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec) is a one-
time intravenous gene therapy designed to address the 
genetic root cause of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) 
by replacing the function of the missing or nonworking 
SMN1 gene. Zolgensma delivers a new working copy 
of the human SMN gene into a patient’s cells. It is 
approved in the US, the EU and other countries to treat:
•	 Babies and young children who have SMA with bial‑
lelic mutations in the SMN1 gene. SMA is a rare, 
genetic neuromuscular disease resulting in the pro‑
gressive and irreversible loss of motor neurons, 
affecting muscle functions, including breathing, swal‑
lowing and basic movement
Approved indications vary by country.
•	 Lucentis (ranibizumab) is a humanized, high-affinity 
antibody fragment that binds to vascular endothelial 
growth factor A (VEGF‑A), a protein that can cause the 
growth of blood vessels in the eye, potentially leading 
to vision loss. Lucentis is an anti-VEGF therapy that is 
injected into the eye. It is approved in the EU and other 
countries to treat patients with certain eye conditions, 
including:
•	 Adults with neovascular (wet) age‑related macular 
degeneration (AMD). Wet AMD develops when 
abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula and 
leak blood and other fluids in the back of the eye, 
which damages the macula
•	 Adults with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, moder‑
ately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic ret‑
inopathy, and/or visual impairment due to diabetic 
macular edema. These conditions are complications 
of diabetes
•	 Adults with visual impairment due to macular edema 
secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or 
central RVO). Retinal vein occlusion is a blockage of 
the branch or central retinal veins, which carry blood 
away from the retina
Approved indications vary by country. Lucentis is 
licensed from Genentech, and Novartis holds the rights 
to commercialize the product outside the US. Genen‑
tech holds the rights to commercialize Lucentis in the 
US. 
•	 Leqvio (inclisiran) is the first and only approved small-in‑
terfering RNA therapy to reduce LDL cholesterol, a risk 
factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
(ASCVD), which is caused by plaque buildup in the 
arteries. Leqvio is administered by a healthcare pro‑
fessional twice a year as an injection, except in the first 
year of treatment where, following an initial dose, 
another dose is required after three months. It is 
approved:
•	 In the EU and other countries to treat adults with pri‑
mary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial 
and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunct 
to diet. Leqvio is used in combination with a statin or 
statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients 
unable to reach LDL cholesterol goals with the max‑
imum tolerated dose of a statin, or alone or in com‑
bination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients 
who are statin-intolerant or for whom a statin is con‑
traindicated. Primary hypercholesterolemia and 
mixed dyslipidemia are disorders characterized by 
high levels of fats (lipids) in the blood

•	 In the US to treat adults with primary hyperlipidemia, 
including heterozygous familial hypercholesterol‑
emia (HeFH), as an adjunct to diet and statin therapy 
to reduce LDL cholesterol. Primary hyperlipidemia, 
also known as high cholesterol, is characterized by 
high levels of fats in the blood 
Novartis obtained global rights to develop, manufac‑
ture and commercialize Leqvio under a license and col‑
laboration agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc. 
•	 Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate/lutetium (177Lu) oxo‑
dotreotide) is an intravenous targeted radioligand ther‑
apy approved in the US, the EU and other countries to

enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-
NETs). GEP-NETs are rare tumors found in the diges‑
tive tract
Approved indications vary by country.
•	 Scemblix (asciminib) is an oral kinase inhibitor that 
works by binding to a part of the BCR-ABL protein 
called the ABL myristoyl pocket. It is approved: 
•	 In the EU and other countries to treat adults with Phil‑
adelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leu‑
kemia (Ph+ CML) in the chronic phase (CP) who have 
previously been treated with two or more tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Ph+ CML is a cancer that 
starts in the blood-forming cells of bone marrow 
•	 In the US to treat both newly diagnosed, and previ‑
ously treated adults with Ph+ CML in CP 
•	 In the US and other countries to treat adults with Ph+ 
CML in the chronic phase with the T315I mutation. 
The T315I mutation causes resistance to most avail‑
able TKI therapies and, as a result, patients with this 
mutation would otherwise have limited treatment 
options
•	 Fabhalta (iptacopan) is an oral Factor B inhibitor of the 
alternative complement pathway, a part of the innate 
immune system involved in triggering inflammation and 
fighting infections. It is approved:
•	 In the US, the EU and other countries to treat adults 
with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). 
PNH is a rare chronic blood disorder in which red 
blood cells are susceptible to premature destruction 
by the complement system
•	 In the US, for the reduction of proteinuria in adults 
with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) 
at risk of rapid disease progression (generally UPCR 
≥1.5 g/g). IgAN is a progressive, rare disease in which 
the immune system attacks the kidneys, which can 
cause glomerular inflammation and proteinuria
Compounds in development
The following table provides an overview of key projects 
currently in the Confirmatory Development stage and 
may also describe certain projects in the Early Develop‑
ment stage. Projects typically enter Confirmatory Devel‑
opment and become the responsibility of our Develop‑
ment organizational unit during Phase II testing. (For 
more information about our drug development program, 
see “—Research and development—Development pro‑
gram.”) Projects are listed in alphabetical order by com‑
pound code, or by product name where applicable. 
Included are projects seeking to develop potential uses 
of new molecular entities as well as potential additional 
indications or new formulations for already marketed 
products. The table below, entitled “Projects removed 
from the development table since 2023,” highlights 
changes to the table entitled “Selected development 
projects” from the previous year.
The year that each project entered the current phase 
of development refers to the year of the first patient’s 
first visit in the first clinical trial of that phase. For proj‑
ects in Phase II, the year generally refers to the first 
patient’s first visit in the first trial in Confirmatory Devel‑
opment. In some cases, the first patient’s first visit in a 
Phase II trial can occur before the Confirmatory Devel‑
opment stage. 
A reference to a project being in registration means 
that an application has been submitted to a health author‑
ity for marketing approval. Compounds and new indica‑
tions in development are subject to required regulatory 
approvals and, in certain instances, contractual limita‑
tions. These compounds and indications are in various 
stages of development throughout the world. It may not 
be possible to obtain regulatory approval for any or all 
of the new compounds and new indications referred to 
in the Form 20‑F in any country or in every country. See 
“—Regulation” for more information on the approval pro‑
cess.

Production
Our primary goal is to ensure the uninterrupted and 
timely supply of medicines that meet all product speci‑
fications and quality standards, and that are produced 
in the most cost-effective and sustainable manner. The 
manufacturing of our products is highly regulated by gov‑
ernmental health authorities around the world, including 
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Euro‑
pean Medicines Agency (EMA). In addition to regulatory 
requirements, many of our products involve technically 
complex manufacturing processes or require highly spe‑
cialized raw materials.
We manufacture our products across the following 
technologies at facilities worldwide: large molecules, 
small molecules, cell and gene therapy, xRNA therapy 
and radioligand therapy (see also “—Item 4.D Property, 
plants and equipment”). We are continuing to integrate 
ADACAP manufacturing sites into our existing manufac‑
turing and supply structure for radioligand therapies. In 
addition, we generate contract manufacturing sales from 
chemistry, biotherapeutics, xRNA and cell and gene ther‑
apy, including fill and finish activities, which we include 
under “established brands” in our consolidated financial 
statements (see “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 4. 
Revenues and geographic information”).
In our manufacturing network, we maintain 
state‑of‑the‑art processes, with quality as a priority, and 
require our suppliers to adhere to the same high stan‑
dards we expect from our own people and processes. 
These processes include chemical and biological syn‑
theses; radioisotope handling; sterile processing, includ‑
ing CAR-T cell processing; gene modification and deliv‑
ery; and formulation and packaging. We are constantly 
working to improve our existing manufacturing pro‑
cesses, develop new and innovative technologies, and 
review and adapt our manufacturing network to maintain 
quality in our manufacturing processes and supply of 
products to customers and patients.
We produce raw materials for manufacturing in‑house 
or purchase them from third-party suppliers. Where pos‑
sible, we maintain multiple supply sources so that the 
business is not dependent on a single or limited number 
of suppliers. However, our ability to do so may at times 
be limited by regulatory or other requirements. We mon‑
itor market developments that could have an adverse 
effect on the supply of essential materials. Our suppliers 
of raw materials are required to comply with applicable 
regulations and Novartis quality standards. 
Because the manufacturing of our products is com‑
plex and highly regulated by governmental health author‑
ities and other regulators, uninterrupted supply cannot 
be guaranteed. If we or our third-party suppliers fail to 
comply with applicable regulations, then there could be 
a product recall or other disruption to our production 
activities. We have experienced supply interruptions for 
our products in the past, and there can be no assurance 
that supply will not be interrupted again in the future. For 
more information on the risks related to the manufactur‑
ing of our products, see “Item 3. Key Information—Item 
3.D Risk factors—Manufacturing and product quality—
Inability to ensure proper controls in product develop‑
ment and product manufacturing, and failure to comply 
with applicable regulations and standards.” We have 
implemented a global manufacturing strategy to maxi‑
mize business continuity in case of such events.  
Marketing and sales
Although specific distribution patterns vary by country, 
Novartis generally sells its prescription drugs primarily 
to drug wholesalers, retailers, private health systems, 
government agencies, managed care providers, phar‑
macy benefit managers, and government-supported 
healthcare systems. We reach healthcare professionals 
and patients in many markets and across our core ther‑
apeutic areas through integrated channels including field 
force operations, patient support programs and Novar‑
tis-owned digital platforms. 
We have 19 135 full-time equivalent field force employ‑
ees, as of December 31, 2024, including supervisors and 
administrative personnel. These trained representatives 
present the therapeutic benefits and risks of our prod‑
ucts to physicians, pharmacists, hospitals, insurance 
groups, managed care organizations and other health‑
care professionals. In the US, Novartis advertises cer‑
tain products via digital and traditional media channels, 
including the internet, television, newspapers and mag‑
azines. Novartis also pursues co‑promotion or co‑mar‑
keting opportunities as well as licensing and distribution 
agreements with other companies in various markets. 
The marketplace for healthcare is constantly evolv‑
ing. Customer groups beyond prescribers have increas‑
ing influence on treatment decisions and guidelines, 
while patients continue to become more informed stake‑
holders in their healthcare decisions and look for solu‑
tions to meet their changing needs. Novartis is respond‑
ing by adapting our business practices to engage 
appropriately with patients, customer groups and other 
stakeholders, including by delivering innovative solutions 
to drive education, access and improved patient care. 
The growing number of so‑called “specialty” drugs 
in our portfolio, such as Cosentyx and Kesimpta, has 
resulted in increased engagement with specialty phar‑
macies. Because many of these drugs require special 
handling and administration, we are rolling out patient 
support programs across our priority markets that serve 
as a central resource for onboarding, education and sup‑
port to help patients navigate their healthcare.
In the US, the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services (CMS) is the largest single payer for healthcare 
services as a result of continuing changes in healthcare 
economics and an aging population. In addition, both 
commercial and government-sponsored managed care 
organizations continue to be among the largest groups 
of payers for healthcare services in the US. In other coun‑
tries, national health services are often the only signifi‑
cant payer for healthcare services. In an effort to control 
prescription drug costs, almost all managed care orga‑
nizations and national health services use formularies 
that list specific drugs that may be reimbursed and/or 
the level of reimbursement for each drug. Managed care 
organizations and national health services also use 
cost‑benefit analyses to determine whether or not newly 
approved drugs will be added to a formulary and/or the 
level of reimbursement for that drug, and to determine 
whether or not to continue to reimburse existing drugs.

We have dedicated teams that actively seek to optimize 
patient access, including formulary positions, for our 
products.
The trend toward consolidation among distributors 
and retailers of our products continues in the US and 
internationally, both within and across countries. This has 
increased our customers’ purchasing leverage and 
resulted in increased pricing pressure on our products. 
Moreover, we are exposed to increased concentration 
of credit risk as a result of the consolidation among our 
customers. 
Drug pricing is an increasingly prominent issue in 
many countries as healthcare spending continues to rise. 
This issue has received significant attention in the US, 
especially with the passage of the Inflation Reduction 
Act (see “—Price controls” for more information). At 
Novartis, we aim to enable patient access through 
innovative pricing and access initiatives in the US, Europe 
and other markets. These include contract structures 
such as pay-over-time and outcome-based agreements.
Competition
The global pharmaceutical market is highly competitive. 
We compete against other major international corpora‑
tions that have substantial financial and other resources, 
as well as against smaller companies that operate region‑
ally or nationally. Competition within the industry is 
intense and extends across a wide range of activities, 
including pricing, product characteristics, customer ser‑
vice, sales and marketing, and research and develop‑
ment.
Like 
other 
companies 
selling 
patented 
pharmaceuticals, Novartis faces challenges from com‑
panies selling competing patented products. Generic 
forms of our products may follow the expiration of intel‑
lectual property protection or regulatory exclusivities, 
and generic companies may also gain entry to the mar‑
ket through successfully challenging our intellectual 
property rights and exclusivities. We use appropriate, 
legally permissible measures to defend those rights and 
exclusivities (see also “—Intellectual property” below). 
There is ongoing consolidation in the pharmaceuti‑
cal industry. At the same time, new entrants are looking 
to use their expertise to establish or expand their pres‑
ence in healthcare. Technology companies, for instance, 
are seeking to benefit from the increasing importance 
of data and data management in our industry, including 
the use of artificial intelligence.
Research and development
The discovery and development of a new drug usually 
requires approximately 10 to 15 years from the initial 
research to bringing a drug to market. This includes 
approximately six to eight years from Phase I clinical tri‑
als to market entry. At each of these steps, there is a 
substantial risk that a therapeutic candidate will not meet 
the requirements to progress further. In such an event, 
we may be required to abandon the development of a 
potential therapy in which we have made a substantial 
investment.
We manage our research and development expendi‑
tures across our entire portfolio in accordance with our 
strategic priorities. We make decisions about whether 
or not to proceed with development projects on a proj‑
ect‑by‑project basis. These decisions are based on the 
project’s potential to meet a significant unmet medical 
need or to improve patient outcomes, the strength of the 
science underlying the project, and the potential of the 
project (subject to the risks inherent in pharmaceutical 
development) to generate significant positive financial 
results for the Company. Once a management decision 
has been made to proceed with the development of a 
therapeutic candidate, the level of research and devel‑
opment investment required will be driven by many fac‑
tors. These include the medical indications for which it 
is being developed, the number, sequence and timing of 
indications being pursued, whether the therapeutic can‑
didate is of a chemical or biological nature, the stage of 
development, and the level of evidence necessary to 
demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety. 
Research program
Our research and early development program is con‑
ducted by our Biomedical Research organizational unit, 
which is the innovation engine of Novartis. This unit is 
responsible for the discovery and first clinical evaluation 
of new medicines that bring value for patients and the 
Company. This requires hiring and retaining highly tal‑
ented employees, focusing on fundamental disease 
mechanisms that are relevant across different disease 
areas, continuously improving technologies for drug dis‑
covery and potential therapies, working with patients to 
understand their diseases and the potential benefits of 
therapies, forming close alliances with clinical and com‑
mercial colleagues, and establishing strategic external 
alliances.
We have 5 582 full‑time-equivalent scientists, physi‑
cians and business professionals at Biomedical Research 
sites in Basel, Switzerland; Cambridge, Massachusetts; 
East Hanover, New Jersey; San Diego, California; and 
Emeryville, California. They contribute to research in our 
core therapeutic areas of cardiovascular, renal and met‑
abolic diseases; neuroscience; oncology; and immunol‑
ogy, among others. Research at the Friedrich Miescher 
Institute focuses on basic genetic and genomic research, 
and our Global Health Disease Area (formerly the 
Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases) focuses on dis‑
covering new medicines to fight tropical diseases, includ‑
ing malaria and cryptosporidiosis. 
All drug candidates go through clinical trials to enable 
an early assessment of the safety and efficacy of the 
drug while collecting basic information on how the drug 
moves through the body and is tolerated, and adhering 
to the guidance for early clinical testing set forth by 
health authorities. When assessments are favorable, our 
Development organizational unit conducts confirmatory 
trials on the drug candidates to generate data that can 
be submitted to regulatory authorities to secure approval 
for patient use.

Development program
Our Development organizational unit oversees and exe‑
cutes drug development activities in our core therapeu‑
tic areas, working collaboratively with Biomedical 
Research, our commercial units and other parts of the 
Company on our overall pipeline strategy. It includes cen‑
tralized functions such as Regulatory Affairs, Medical 
Affairs and Global Clinical Operations, and has 12 773 
full‑time equivalent employees worldwide. 
The traditional model of clinical development consists 
of three phases:
Phase I: The first clinical trials of a new compound – gen‑
erally performed in a small number of healthy human vol‑
unteers or patients (e.g., in oncology) – to assess the 
drug’s safety profile, including the safe dosage range. 
These trials also determine how a drug is absorbed, dis‑
tributed, metabolized and excreted, and the duration of 
its action.
Phase II: Studies performed with patients who have the 
target disease, with the aim of continuing the Phase I 
safety assessment in a larger group, assessing the effi‑
cacy of the drug in the patient population, and determin‑
ing the appropriate doses for further evaluation.
Phase III: Large‑scale studies with up to several thou‑
sand patients, which aim to establish the safety and effi‑
cacy of the drug in specific indications for regulatory 
approval. Phase III trials may also be used to compare a 
new drug against a current standard of care to evaluate 
the overall benefit‑risk relationship of the new medicine.
In each of these phases, physicians monitor consenting 
volunteers or patients closely to assess the safety and 
efficacy of a potential new drug or indication.
Although we use this traditional model, we take a flex‑
ible and efficient approach based on close collaboration 
across R&D, enabling Development teams to initiate lat‑
er-stage planning in parallel with early evaluations and 
research teams to better support later-stage activities. 
Our development process consists of two stages: 
Early Development to build confidence in the overall 
properties of the compound, followed by Confirmatory 
Development to confirm the concept in large numbers 
of patients. Early development consists of both Phase I 
studies in healthy volunteers as well as Phase Ib and 
Phase II studies in patients. This work includes a careful 
review of safety and tolerability, understanding of 
whether the drug is modulating the target of interest, and 
understanding of dose response and early evidence of 
disease efficacy. Biomedical Research conducts these 
trials and if this evaluation is positive, the drug moves to 
the Confirmatory Development stage and becomes the 
responsibility of Development. 
Confirmatory Development has elements of tradi‑
tional Phase II/III testing and includes trials aimed at con‑
firming the safety and efficacy of the drug in the given 
indication, leading up to submission of a dossier to health 
authorities for approval. This stage can also include tri‑
als that compare the drug to the current standard of care 
for the disease in order to evaluate the drug’s overall ben‑
efit-risk profile. Further, with new treatment approaches 
such as gene therapy for rare diseases, elements of Early 
and Confirmatory Development may be combined and 
suffice for registration under certain conditions such as 
high unmet medical need and clinical data showing highly 
favorable benefit-risk profiles. In these cases, additional 
post-approval studies may be required by the regulatory 
authorities to continue to gather important data to fur‑
ther support approval.  
The vast amount of data that must be collected and 
evaluated makes clinical testing the most time‑consum‑
ing and expensive part of new drug development. The 
next stage in the drug development process is to seek 
registration for the new drug. For more information, see 
“—Regulation.”
The Innovation Management Board (IMB), chaired by 
our Chief Executive Officer, drives our R&D portfolio 
strategy. The IMB endorses new early- and late-stage 
development projects, strategic plans and portfolio-re‑
lated priorities. It oversees our drug development bud‑
get; approves major project phase transitions; and makes 
key decisions, such as when to submit regulatory appli‑
cations to health authorities or when to discontinue proj‑
ects. IMB members include representatives from the 
Executive Committee of Novartis (ECN) and senior man‑
agement with expertise in different fields.
To support our R&D strategy, we are investing in AI 
and other technologies that have the potential to enhance 
and accelerate the delivery of innovative medicines to 
patients. We are working with partners on scalable proj‑
ects in early-stage research and in clinical development 
to help improve our decision-making and generate 
actionable insights across our core therapeutic areas—
from designing new compounds to predicting drug safety 
and conducting clinical trials. In addition, we are contin‑
uously adapting our organizational setup to drive a lead‑
ing and sustainable R&D performance, by building future 
capabilities across our Development organization and 
accessing global talent pools.
Alliances and acquisitions 
Novartis enters into business development agreements 
with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
and with academic and other institutions to develop new 
products and access new markets. We license products 
that complement our current product line and are appro‑
priate to our business strategy. We focus on strategic 
alliances and acquisition activities for key disease areas 
and indications that we expect to be growth drivers in 
the future. We review products and compounds we are 
considering licensing, using the same criteria that we use 
for our own internally discovered drugs.
In May 2024, Novartis acquired Mariana Oncology, a 
US based, preclinical biotechnology company focused 
on developing novel radioligand therapies across a range 
of solid tumors. The acquisition brings a robust portfolio 
of RLT programs, including MC-339, an actinium-based 
RLT being investigated in small cell lung cancer. 
In May 2024, Novartis acquired an 89.7% interest in 
MorphoSys AG, a German based biopharmaceuticals 
company, which owns the following assets: pelabresib 
(late-stage BET inhibitor for myelofibrosis) and tulmime‑
tostat (early-stage dual EZH2 and EZH1 inhibitor for solid 
tumors or lymphomas). In October 2024, Novartis com‑
pleted the acquisition of the remaining outstanding

shares of MorphoSys AG, making MorphoSys AG a whol‑
ly-owned subsidiary of Novartis. 
Additionally in October 2024, Novartis acquired Kate 
Therapeutics, Inc., a US based, preclinical biotechnology 
company focused on developing adeno-associated 
viruses (AAV)-based gene therapies to treat genetically 
defined muscle and heart diseases.

see “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 2. Significant 
acquisitions of businesses and spin-off of Sandoz busi‑
ness.”
Regulation
The international pharmaceutical industry is highly reg‑
ulated. Regulatory authorities around the world admin‑
ister numerous laws and regulations regarding the test‑
ing, approval, manufacturing, importing, labeling and 
marketing of drugs, and review the safety and efficacy 
of pharmaceutical products. Extensive controls exist on 
the non‑clinical and clinical development of pharmaceu‑
tical products. These regulatory requirements, and the 
implementation of them by local health authorities around 
the globe, are a major factor in determining whether a 
substance can be developed into a marketable product, 
and the amount of time and expense associated with 
that development.
Health authorities, including those in the US and the 
EU, have high standards of technical evaluation. The 
introduction of new pharmaceutical products generally 
entails a lengthy approval process. Products must be 
authorized or registered prior to marketing, and such 
authorization or registration must subsequently be main‑
tained. In recent years, the registration process has 
required increased testing and documentation for the 
approval of new drugs, with a corresponding increase in 
the expense of product introduction.
To register a pharmaceutical product, a registration 
dossier containing evidence establishing the safety, effi‑
cacy and quality of the product must be submitted to 
regulatory authorities. Generally, a therapeutic product 
must be registered in each country in which it will be sold. 
In every country, the submission of an application to a 
regulatory authority does not guarantee that approval to 
market the product will be granted. Although the criteria 
for the registration of therapeutic drugs are similar in 
most countries, the formal structure of the necessary 
registration documents and the specific requirements, 
including risk tolerance, of the local health authorities 
can vary significantly from country to country. Even if a 
drug is registered and marketed in one country, the reg‑
istration authority in another country may request addi‑
tional information from the pharmaceutical company 
prior to registration or even reject the product. A drug 
may be approved for different indications in different 
countries.
The registration process generally takes between six 
months and several years, depending on the country, the 
quality of the data submitted, the efficiency of the regis‑
tration authority’s procedures, and the nature of the 
product. Many countries provide for accelerated pro‑
cessing of registration applications for innovative 
products of particular therapeutic interest. In recent 
years, the US and the EU have made efforts to harmo‑
nize registration requirements in order to achieve shorter 
development and registration times for medical prod‑
ucts. However, the requirement in many countries to 
negotiate selling prices or reimbursement levels with 
government regulators and other payers can substan‑
tially extend the time until a product may finally be avail‑
able to patients.
The following provides a summary of the regulatory 
processes in the principal markets served by our affili‑
ates:
United States
In the US, applications for drug registration are submit‑
ted to and reviewed by the FDA. The FDA regulates the 
testing, manufacturing, labeling and approval for market‑
ing of pharmaceutical products intended for commer‑
cialization in the US. The FDA continues to monitor the 
safety of pharmaceutical products after they have been 
approved for sale in the US market. The pharmaceutical 
development and registration process is typically inten‑
sive, lengthy and rigorous. When a pharmaceutical com‑
pany has gathered data that it believes sufficiently 
demonstrates a drug’s safety, efficacy and quality, the 
company may file a New Drug Application (NDA) or Bio‑
logics License Application (BLA), as applicable, for the 
compound. The NDA or BLA must contain all the scien‑
tific information that has been gathered about the com‑
pound. This typically includes information regarding the 
clinical experiences of patients tested in the drug’s clin‑
ical trials. A Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) 
or Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) 
must be filed for new indications and dosage forms for 
a previously approved drug.
Once an application is submitted, the FDA assigns 
reviewers from its staff, including experts in biopharma‑
ceutics, chemistry, clinical microbiology, pharmacology/
toxicology, and statistics. After a complete review, these 
content experts provide written evaluations of the NDA 
or BLA. These recommendations are consolidated and 
are used by senior FDA staff in its final evaluation of the 
NDA or BLA. Based on that final evaluation, the FDA then 
either approves the NDA or BLA, or provides a “complete 
response” letter if the NDA or BLA application is not 
approved. If not approved, the letter will state the spe‑
cific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA that need to be 
addressed. The company making the application must 
then submit an adequate response to the deficiencies in 
order to restart the review procedure.
Once the FDA has approved an NDA, BLA, sNDA or 
sBLA, the company can make the new drug available for 
physicians and other healthcare providers to prescribe. 
The drug owner must submit periodic reports to the FDA, 
including any cases of adverse reactions. For some med‑
ications, the FDA requires additional post‑approval stud‑
ies (Phase IV) to evaluate long‑term effects or to gather 
information on the use of the product under specified 
conditions.
Throughout the life cycle of a product, the FDA 
requires compliance with standards relating to good lab‑
oratory, clinical and manufacturing practices. The FDA 
also requires compliance with rules pertaining to the 
manner in which we may promote our products.

European Union
In the EU, there are three main procedures for applica‑
tion for authorization to market pharmaceutical products 
in more than one EU member state at the same time: the 
centralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure 
and the decentralized procedure. It is also possible to 
obtain a national authorization for products intended for 
commercialization in a single EU member state only. The 
procedure used for first authorization must continue to 
be followed for subsequent changes, e.g., to add an indi‑
cation for a licensed product.
Under the centralized procedure, applications are 
made to the EMA for an authorization that is valid for the 
European Union (all member states). The centralized pro‑
cedure is mandatory for all biotechnology products; new 
chemical entities in cancer, neurodegenerative disor‑
ders, diabetes, AIDS, autoimmune diseases and other 
immune dysfunctions; advanced therapy medicines, 
such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tis‑
sue-engineered medicines; and orphan medicines 
(medicines for rare diseases). It is optional for other new 
chemical entities, innovative medicinal products, and 
medicines for which authorization would be in the inter‑
est of public health. When a pharmaceutical company 
has gathered data that it believes sufficiently demon‑
strates a drug’s safety, efficacy and quality, the company 
may submit an application to the EMA. The EMA then 
receives and validates the application, and the special‑
ized committee for human medicines, the CHMP, appoints 
a rapporteur and co‑rapporteur to review it. They use 
experts from their countries to carry out the assessment 
but can also draw on expertise from other member states 
(“multinational teams”). The entire review cycle must be 
completed within 210 days, although there are “clock 
stops” to allow the company to respond to questions set 
forth in the rapporteur and co‑rapporteur’s assessment 
report and agreed with the CHMP. The first clock stop 
is at Day 120 and the clock restarts on Day 121, when the 
company’s complete response is received by the EMA. 
If there are further aspects of the dossier requiring clar‑
ification, the CHMP will issue further questions at Day 
180, and may also request an oral explanation, in which 
case the sponsor must not only respond to the further 
questions but also appear before the committee to jus‑
tify its responses. On Day 210, the CHMP will take a vote 
to recommend the approval or non‑approval of the appli‑
cation, and their opinion is transferred to the European 
Commission (EC). The final EC decision under this cen‑
tralized procedure is a single decision that is applicable 
to all member states. This decision occurs 60 days, on 
average, after a positive CHMP recommendation.
Under both the mutual recognition procedure (MRP) 
and the decentralized procedure (DCP), the assessment 
is led by one member state, called the reference mem‑
ber state (RMS), which then liaises with other member 
states, known as the concerned member states. In the 
MRP, the company first obtains a marketing authoriza‑
tion in the RMS, which is then recognized by the con‑
cerned member states within 90 days. In the DCP, the 
application is done simultaneously in the RMS and all 
concerned member states. During the DCP, the RMS 
drafts an assessment report within 120 days. Within an 
additional 90 days, the concerned member states review 
the application and can issue objections or requests for 
additional information. On Day 90, each concerned mem‑
ber state must be assured that the product is safe and 
effective, and that it will cause no undue risks to the pub‑
lic health. Once an agreement has been reached, each 
member state grants national marketing authorizations 
for the product.
After receiving the marketing authorizations, the 
company must submit periodic safety reports to the rel‑
evant health authority (EMA for the centralized proce‑
dure, national health authorities for DCP or MRP). In addi‑
tion, pharmacovigilance measures must be implemented 
and monitored, including the collection, evaluation and 
expedited reporting of adverse events, and updates to 
risk management plans. For some medications, post-ap‑
proval studies (Phase IV) may be imposed to comple‑
ment available data with additional data to evaluate long-
term effects (called a Post-Approval Safety Study, or 
PASS) or to gather additional efficacy data (called a 
Post-Approval Efficacy Study, or PAES).
European marketing authorizations have an initial 
duration of five years. The holder of the marketing autho‑
rization must actively apply for its renewal after this first 
five-year period. As part of the renewal procedure, the 
competent authority performs a full benefit‑risk review 
of the product. Should the authority conclude that the 
benefit‑risk balance is no longer positive, the marketing 
authorization can be suspended or revoked. Once 
renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlim‑
ited period, unless it is determined that the product must 
be further monitored for safety reasons. In this case, the 
authority may require another renewal at 10 years. If the 
holder does not apply for renewal, the marketing autho‑
rization automatically lapses. Any marketing authoriza‑
tion that is not followed within three years of its granting 
by the actual placing on the market of the correspond‑
ing medicinal product ceases to be valid. 
Price controls
In most of the markets where we operate, the prices of 
pharmaceutical products are subject to both direct and 
indirect price controls and to drug reimbursement pro‑
grams with varying price control mechanisms. Due to 
increasing political pressure and governmental budget 
constraints, we expect these mechanisms to remain 
robust – and potentially even be strengthened – and to 
have a continued negative influence on the prices we are 
able to charge for our products.
Direct governmental efforts to control prices
United States: The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), 
signed into law in August 2022, mandates that eligible 
Medicare Part B and Part D drugs participate in what the 
statute calls the Drug Price Negotiation Program (Pro‑
gram); redesigned the Medicare Part D benefit, includ‑
ing a USD 2 000 out-of-pocket cap for Medicare bene‑
ficiaries going into effect in 2025; and imposed penalties 
for Medicare drugs that increase in price faster than the 
rate of inflation. Under the Program, the US government 
will set Medicare prices for selected products it has 
defined as single-sourced small-molecule drugs that 
have been on the market for seven years following FDA 
approval as well as single-sourced biologics that have


### Page 37 ###

Item 4.  Information on the Company

33
been on the market for 11 years after FDA approval, and 
will become effective for selected drugs two years later 
(nine years after FDA approval for eligible small mole‑
cules and 13 years after FDA approval for eligible biolog‑
ics).
Medicare drugs with the highest total cost to the US 
government are selected for the Program as they become 
eligible. Exemptions include orphan drugs with a desig‑
nation for one rare disease or condition, drugs with a 
total cost to Medicare of less than USD 200 million, and 
plasma-derived drugs.   
The IRA will be implemented as follows:
•	 10 eligible Medicare Part D drugs in 2026 
•	 An additional 15 eligible Medicare Part D drugs in 2027
•	 An additional 15 eligible combined Medicare Part B and 
Part D drugs in 2028
•	 An additional 20 eligible combined Medicare Part B 
and Part D drugs in 2029 
•	 An additional 20 eligible combined Medicare Part B 
and Part D drugs each year after 2029 
On August 29, 2023, the US government released the 
list of the first 10 drugs to be subject to the Program, and 
Entresto was one of the selected products. Novartis has 
completed the process of participating because manu‑
facturers that refuse to participate are subject to an 
excise tax of up to 95% of sales. Novartis has filed a law‑
suit against the US Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) and the US Centers for Medicare & Med‑
icaid Services because we believe the IRA’s drug 
price-setting provisions are unconstitutional and will 
have long-lasting negative consequences for patients by 
limiting access to medicines now and in the future (for 
more information, see “Item 18. Financial Statements—
Note 20. Provisions and other non-current liabilities”). 
We also expect to be affected by other provisions of the 
IRA, such as price increase penalties for Medicare drugs, 
and new mandatory rebates on eligible Medicare Part D 
sales.
In addition, as of December 31, 2024, 24 US states 
had passed legislation intended to impact pricing or 
requiring manufacturers to report price increases to 
states, with eight of these states also allowing for drug 
affordability (i.e., price control) review boards. The dis‑
closure requirements vary by state. Many states require 
multiple types of reporting, including for new drug appli‑
cations, new drug launches, prior notice of price 
increases, and quarterly or annual reporting. 
Europe: In Europe, our operations are subject to signifi‑
cant price and marketing regulations. Many governments 
are introducing healthcare reforms in a further attempt 
to curb increasing healthcare costs. In some member 
states, these include reforms to permit the reimbursed 
use of off-label medicines, despite the presence of 
licensed alternatives on the market. In the EU, govern‑
ments influence the price of pharmaceutical products 
through their control of national healthcare systems that 
fund a large part of the cost of such products to patients. 
The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general 
in the EU, particularly with regard to prescription drugs, 
is intense. Increasingly strict analyses are applied when 
evaluating the entry of new products, and as a result, 
access to innovative medicines is limited based on strict 
cost‑benefit assessments. In addition, prices for mar‑
keted products are referenced within member states and 
across international borders, further impacting individ‑
ual EU member state pricing. Member states also col‑
laborate to enhance pricing transparency and have 
started conducting joint health technology assessments, 
joint pricing negotiations and/or joint purchasing. As an 
additional control for healthcare budgets, some EU coun‑
tries have passed legislation to impose further manda‑
tory rebates for pharmaceutical products and/or finan‑
cial claw‑backs on the pharmaceutical industry. The 
calculation of these rebates and claw‑backs may lack 
transparency in some cases and can be difficult to pre‑
dict.
Regulations favoring generics and biosimilars
In response to rising healthcare costs, most govern‑
ments and private medical care providers have estab‑
lished reimbursement schemes that favor the substitu‑
tion of more expensive brand‑name pharmaceuticals by 
generic pharmaceuticals. All US states have generic sub‑
stitution statutes. These statutes permit or require the 
dispensing pharmacist to substitute a less expensive 
generic drug instead of an original drug. Other countries, 
including many European countries, have similar laws. 
We expect that the pressure for generic substitution will 
continue to increase. In addition, the US, the EU and other 
jurisdictions are increasingly introducing laws and regu‑
lations encouraging the development of biosimilar ver‑
sions of biologic drugs, which can also be expected to 
have an impact on pricing.
Cross‑border sales
Price controls in one country can have an impact in other 
countries as a result of cross‑border sales. In the EU, 
products that we have sold to customers in countries 
with stringent price controls can be legally resold to cus‑
tomers in other EU countries at a lower price than the 
price at which the product is otherwise available in the 
importing country (known as parallel trade). In North 
America, products that we have sold to customers in 
Canada – which has relatively stringent price controls – 
are sometimes resold into the US, again at a lower price 
than the price at which the product is otherwise sold in 
the US. Reimportation from Canada and other countries 
into the US for commercial purposes is currently illegal. 
An exception is that states may seek approval from the 
Secretary of HHS to establish a Canadian drug impor‑
tation program. Seven US states (Colorado, Florida, 
Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and Ver‑
mont) have enacted laws authorizing the establishment 
of such a program. However, the Secretary of the HHS 
must approve each state importation plan before it can 
be implemented.  As of December 31, 2024, Florida is 
the only state to receive FDA approval for a state impor‑
tation plan, but has not yet implemented it.
We expect that pressures on pricing will continue 
worldwide and will likely increase. Because of these 
pressures, there can be no certainty that in every instance 
we will be able to charge prices for a product that, in a 
particular country or in the aggregate, would enable us 
to earn an adequate return on our investment in that 
product.

Intellectual property
Intellectual property (IP) rights, including patents, trade‑
marks, copyrights, know-how, and trade secrets, as well 
as regulatory-based protections, are essential to our busi‑
ness as an innovative medicines company and protect our 
innovation and investments in research and development, 
manufacturing, and marketing of our products. 
Patents
Patents may cover a product itself, including the prod‑
uct’s active ingredient or other ingredients and its for‑
mulation. Patents may also cover processes for manu‑
facturing 
a 
product, 
including 
processes 
for 
manufacturing intermediate substances used in the man‑
ufacture of the product. In addition, patents may cover 
particular uses of a product, such as its use to treat a 
particular disease, or its dosage regimen. Further, pat‑
ents may cover tests for certain diseases or biomarkers 
– which can improve patient outcomes when adminis‑
tered with certain drugs – as well as assays, research 
tools, and other techniques used to identify new drugs.
United States
•	 In the US, an issued patent will generally receive a term 
of 20 years from the earliest application filing date and 
may be eligible for potential patent term adjustments 
if there are delays in prosecution of the patent by the 
United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). 
•	 A US pharmaceutical patent may also be eligible for a 
patent term extension (PTE) given that the develop‑
ment of a pharmaceutical product and its review by the 
FDA can take an extended period of time. PTE provides 
an extension of patent term to compensate for the time 
taken to conduct clinical trials and for the FDA’s review 
process. The PTE may only extend the patent term for 
a maximum of five years and may not extend the pat‑
ent term beyond 14 years from regulatory approval. For 
a patent to be eligible for PTE, the patent must claim 
the product, a method of using the product, or a method 
of manufacturing the product. In addition, only one pat‑
ent may be extended for any product.
European Union
•	 Patent applications in Europe may be filed in the Euro‑
pean Patent Office (EPO) or in the patent offices of 
particular countries. The term of a patent granted by 
the EPO or an EU country’s patent office is 20 years 
from the earliest application filing date. A patent issued 
by the EPO may also become a Unitary Patent, enforce‑
able in multiple countries in the EU.
•	 Given that the development of a pharmaceutical prod‑
uct and its review by health authorities in the EU can 
take an extended period of time, a pharmaceutical pat‑
ent in the EU may be eligible for a patent term exten‑
sion that is called a supplementary protection certifi‑
cate (SPC). An SPC may only extend the term of a 
patent for a maximum of five years, and may not extend 
the term of the patent beyond 15 years from the date 
of the first EU marketing authorization for the product 
covered by the patent. There is no unified procedure 
among countries in the EU for obtaining an SPC and 
SPCs must be applied for and granted on a coun‑
try-by-country basis.
Whether we are granted PTEs or SPCs, and the duration 
thereof, may depend upon many factors, including 
whether we have exercised due diligence during the 
product testing phase or regulatory review process, have 
applied for the extension within applicable deadlines, and 
satisfied all other applicable requirements. Moreover, the 
applicable time period or the scope of patent protection 
afforded could be less than we request.
RDP and market exclusivity
In addition to patent protection, various countries pro‑
vide regulatory-based protection, including regulatory 
data protection (RDP) and/or other market exclusivities, 
for a prescribed period of time. RDP provides exclusiv‑
ity that precludes a potential competitor from filing a reg‑
ulatory application that relies on the sponsor’s clinical 
trial data, or that precludes the regulatory authority from 
approving the application for a set period of time. 
United States
•	 A new small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredi‑
ent receives five years of RDP, during which time a com‑
petitor generally may not obtain final approval of an 
application to the FDA based on a sponsor’s clinical 
data.
•	 A new biologic active pharmaceutical ingredient 
receives 12 years of regulatory-based market exclusiv‑
ity, during which time a competitor generally may not 
market the same or similar drug.
•	 The FDA may also request that a sponsor conduct 
pediatric studies and, in exchange, it will grant an addi‑
tional six-month period of pediatric market exclusivity 
if the sponsor makes a timely submission of the reports 
of the pediatric studies in response to the FDA’s writ‑
ten request. The sponsor must also have a patent-based 
and/or regulatory-based exclusivity period for the 
product to which the pediatric market exclusivity is 
appended.
•	 Orphan drug exclusivity (ODE) provides seven years 
of market exclusivity for drugs designated by the FDA 
as orphan drugs, meaning drugs that treat rare dis‑
eases affecting fewer than 200 000 people in the US. 
During this period, a potential competitor generally may 
not market the same or similar drug for the same indi‑
cation even if the competitor’s application does not rely 
on data from the sponsor.
European Union
•	 A new pharmaceutical ingredient receives eight years 
of data protection, during which a competitor cannot 
rely on the relevant data; a further period of two years 
of market exclusivity, during which the data can be used 
to support applications for marketing authorization but 
a competitive product cannot be launched; and a pos‑
sible one-year extension of the market exclusivity 
period if, during the initial eight-year data exclusivity 
period, the sponsor registered a new therapeutic indi‑
cation with “significant clinical benefit.”
•	 ODE provides for 10 years of market exclusivity, during 
which time an application for the same or similar med‑
icine for the same indication will not generally be 
accepted or granted. Under certain circumstances, this 
exclusivity can be extended with a two-year pediatric 
extension.

Third-party patents and challenges to intellectual 
property
Third parties can challenge our IP, including patents, 
PTEs, SPCs, RDP, and marketing exclusivities (such as 
pediatric extensions and ODE), through various proceed‑
ings. For example, patents in the US can be challenged 
in the USPTO through various proceedings, including 
inter partes review (IPR) and post-grant review (PGR) 
proceedings. They may also be challenged through pat‑
ent infringement litigation under the Abbreviated New 
Drug Application (ANDA) provisions of the Hatch-Wax‑
man Act or under the Biologics Price Competition and 
Innovation Act (BPCIA). In the EU, patents may be chal‑
lenged through oppositions in the EPO, revocation 
actions before the Unified Patent Court, or national pat‑
ents may be challenged in national courts or national 
patent offices. The outcomes of such challenges can be 
difficult to predict.
In addition to directly challenging our IP rights, in 
some circumstances a competitor may be able to mar‑
ket a generic version of one of our products by, for exam‑
ple, designing around our patents or marketing the 
generic product for non-patent-protected indications, or 
filing a separate New Drug Application (NDA) under the 
Hatch-Waxman Act (typically referred to as a 505(b)(2) 
application). Despite RDP, a competitor could opt to incur 
the costs of conducting its own clinical trials and prepar‑
ing its own regulatory application and avoid our RDP alto‑
gether. There is a risk that some countries may seek to 
impose limitations on or seek not to recognize the avail‑
ability of IP rights for pharmaceutical products, or limit 
the extent to which such rights may be enforced. Addi‑
tionally, even though we may own, co-own or in-license 
patents protecting our products, and conduct free‑
dom-to-operate analyses, a third party may nevertheless 
assert that one of our products infringes or otherwise 
violates a third-party patent or other intellectual prop‑
erty right for which we do not have a license, seeking 
remedies such as monetary damages or an injunction 
against our continued marketing of the product.
As a result, there can be no assurance that our IP 
rights will protect our products or that we will be able to 
avoid adverse effects from the loss of IP protection or 
from third-party patents or other intellectual property 
rights in the future. For more information on the risks 
related to IP, see “Item 3. Key Information—Item 3.D Risk 
factors—Intellectual property—Expiry, assertion or loss 
of intellectual property protection.”
Intellectual property protection for certain key 
marketed products and compounds in 
development
The following chart lists our key marketed products 
together with the year in which, unless otherwise indi‑
cated, the basic composition of matter (CoM) patent pro‑
tection (including granted PTEs, granted SPCs, and 
granted pediatric exclusivity periods) or regulatory exclu‑
sivity (for example, RDP or ODE), whichever lasts longer, 
is currently estimated to expire in the US and EU. We also 
sell these products in other countries, but do not include 
exclusivity loss on a country-by-country basis, which 
may vary considerably from the estimated loss in the US 
and EU. Generally, the dates in the table below for each 
of the products are estimated only for the purpose of 
business or financial planning. Moreover, where applica‑
ble, we provide information regarding current challenges 
involving the patents or regulatory exclusivities expiring 
on the listed dates. In addition, we may own, co-own, 
control, or have rights to additional, later-expiring pat‑
ents relating, for example, to compound forms, methods 
of treatment or use, formulations, devices, processes, 
product-by-process, synthesis, purification, and assays. 
We may also be seeking or may have been granted forms 
of regulatory exclusivity that may expire later than the 
dates shown below. These later-expiring patents or RDP 
may or may not protect our products from generic or bio‑
similar competition after the date specified. 
It is not possible to predict with certainty the length 
of patent or regulatory-based market exclusivity for any 
of our products because of the complex interaction 
between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity and 
inherent uncertainties regarding IP litigation. There can 
be no assurance that a particular product will receive 
patent or regulatory-based market exclusivity for the full 
period of time that we estimate, or at all, and the prod‑
ucts listed below may face generic or biosimilar compe‑
tition in the US or EU earlier than the dates listed below. 
See “Item 3. Key Information—Item 3.D Risk factors—
Intellectual property—Expiry, assertion or loss of intel‑
lectual property protection” for additional information.

As our product portfolio evolves, the Company is adapt‑
ing our manufacturing capacity and capabilities to meet 
our changing needs, shifting from high-volume products 
toward lower-volume, customized and personalized 
medicines. As of December 31, 2024, we have closed, 
exited, consolidated or sold 7 Novartis manufacturing 
sites post 2021. We continue expanding our capacity in 
new technologies such as cell culture, biopharmaceuti‑
cal manufacturing and radioligand therapy, including the 
investment in in-house production of isotopes critical for 
production of radioligand therapies. We are leveraging 
innovation to increase the reliability and productivity of 
our manufacturing network, including using data and dig‑
ital technologies. We continue to seek opportunities to 
manage our production facilities as efficiently as possi‑
ble, optimize external spend, and simplify and standard‑
ize across our manufacturing network to help us increase 
our cost competitiveness and optimize the value of our 
products. At the same time, we are working to improve 
our environmental sustainability, for example by reduc‑
ing energy, waste disposal and water consumption at our 
sites by making our manufacturing processes more effi‑
cient, introducing new technologies, and switching to 
clean and renewable energy solutions.

cial Review (Lagebericht), as defined by the Swiss Code 
of Obligations. 
The discussion of our operating and financial review 
and prospects for the years ended December 31, 2023 
and December 31, 2022 can be found in “Item 5. Oper-
ating and Financial Review and Prospects — 5.A. Oper-

Form 20-F filed on January 31, 2024.
Overview
Novartis is an innovative medicines company engaged 
in the research, development, manufacturing, distribu-
tion, marketing and sale of a broad range of innovative 
pharmaceutical medicines. Our purpose is to reimagine 
medicine to improve and extend people’s lives by lever-
aging our scientific expertise to find new ways to treat 
and cure disease. Our operations are organized into five 
organizational units: Biomedical Research, Development, 
Operations, and two commercial units US and Interna-
tional. Global functions support these organizational 
units in the execution of their work. We focus on four 
core therapeutic areas with strong growth potential and 
high unmet patient needs—cardiovascular, renal and 
metabolic; immunology; neuroscience; and oncology. For 
more information about our organizational structure, see 
“Item 4. Information on the Company—Item 4.B Overview.” 
Following the September 15, 2023, shareholders’ 
approval of the spin-off of the Sandoz business, Novartis 
reported the Company’s consolidated financial state-
ments as “continuing” and “discontinued” operations, in 
compliance with IFRS Accounting Standards. For more 
information, see “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 1. 
Accounting policies.” 
The disclosures and commentary in this “Item 5. 
Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” focus 
on continuing operations. We also provide information 
on discontinued operations. 
Continuing operations include the retained business 
activities of Novartis, comprising the innovative medicines 
business and continued corporate activities. 
Discontinued operations include the Sandoz generic 
pharmaceuticals and biosimilars division and certain cor-
porate activities attributable to Sandoz prior to the spin-
off up to the distribution date of October 3, 2023, and 
certain other expenses related to the spin-off. Included 
in 2023 is also the IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, 
non-taxable net gain on distribution of Sandoz Group AG 
to Novartis AG shareholders. Sandoz operated in the 
off-patent medicines segment and specialized in the 
development, manufacturing, and marketing of generic 
pharmaceuticals and biosimilars. The Sandoz business 
was organized globally into two franchises: Generics and 
Biosimilars. 
Significant transactions are discussed in “Item 18. 
Financial Statements—Note 2. Significant acquisitions 
of businesses and spin-off of Sandoz business,” and 
“Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 27. Commitments 
and contingent liabilities.” 
Our business environment
Progress in science and technology raises the possibil-
ity of new types of medicines and more efficient drug 
discovery. At the same time, many people struggle to 
access healthcare, while aging populations are putting 
pressure on healthcare systems. The major trends cur-
rently shaping our business environment include:
•	 Scientific progress is opening new paths to treat dis-
ease. Rapid progress in medical science is creating 
opportunities for new types of treatments. These 
advances highlight the importance of investment in 
R&D, including in next-generation technologies such 
as radioligand therapies and gene and cell therapies. 
•	 Demand for high-quality healthcare continues to rise. 
Demand for medicines in areas such as cancer, car-
diovascular disease and immunology continues to grow 
in key markets. The US and EU markets are expanding. 
China is growing rapidly, while spending in Japan is 
forecast to remain stable. 
•	 Healthcare systems are under strain. In many coun-
tries, healthcare systems are under pressure. Long-
term factors such as aging and lifestyle changes have 
led to a significant rise in noncommunicable illnesses 
such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease.
•	 The policy landscape is changing. Evolving legislation 
and regulations are changing how governments pay 
for medicines. In the US, the IRA will impose price con-
trols on select drugs in the Medicare program. The EU 
is revising the legislative framework for medicines, with 
the aim of improving access and affordability, while 
China has rolled out a volume-based procurement pro-
gram to reduce prices for eligible medicines. See “Item 
3. Key Information—Item 3.D Risk factors—Pricing, 
reimbursement and access—Pricing and reimburse-
ment pressure, including pricing transparency and

access to healthcare,” and “Item 3. Key Information—
Item 3.D Risk factors—Macroeconomic develop-
ments—Impact of macroeconomic developments.”
•	 The market for healthcare is evolving. Customer 
groups have increasing influence on treatment deci-
sions and guidelines, while patients continue to become 
more informed stakeholders in their healthcare deci-
sions and look for solutions to meet their changing 
needs.
•	 Access to medicines remains a challenge. Many peo-
ple around the world struggle to access healthcare and 
medicines. The issue is linked to demographic, social 
and economic challenges such as aging, poverty and 
inequality, as well as to structural issues such as lim-
ited healthcare infrastructure, shortages of trained 
healthcare workers, and the cost of healthcare and 
medicines. Improving access requires a holistic 
approach that acknowledges these complex factors 
and relies on stakeholder collaboration and partner-
ships.
•	 AI is poised to reshape the industry. Across the bio-
pharmaceutical industry, we are beginning to realize 
the benefits of new technologies such as AI in auto-
mating processes and generating insights that could 
help us design new compounds, predict drug safety or 
speed up drug discovery. The extent to which compa-
nies can harness this potential will depend on their abil-
ity to aggregate and analyze large volumes of ano-
nymized health data. See “Item 3. Key Information—Item 
3.D Risk factors—Research and development—Failure 
to competitively discover and develop innovative 
medicines in our core therapeutic areas and leverag-
ing our technology platforms.”
•	 Healthcare systems aim to build climate resilience. 
Healthcare systems are aiming to build climate resil-
ience, with 45 countries committing to net-zero carbon 
emissions in their health systems, according to the 
WHO. At the same time, climate change and nature loss 
continue to have adverse effects on human health, 
mainly from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat 
stress, with respiratory illnesses also on the rise due 
to air pollution. See “Item 3. Key Information—Item 3.D 
Risk factors—Climate change—Failure to manage 
physical and transition risks from climate change.”
Our strategy
We focus on four core therapeutic areas with strong 
growth potential and high unmet patient needs: cardio-
vascular, renal and metabolic; immunology; neurosci-
ence; and oncology. This focus enables us to build depth 
in these therapeutic areas, leveraging our scientific 
expertise to find new ways to treat and cure disease, 
intervene earlier in disease pathophysiology, and improve 
quality of life for patients. We focus our exploratory 
research work in these core therapeutic areas, but also 
look beyond them, recognizing that cultivating a robust 
pipeline and remaining on the leading edge of scientific 
discovery requires a slightly wider aperture in early 
research.
We are investing in technology platforms that we 
expect will deliver future high-value medicines. We focus 
on two established platforms (chemistry and biothera-
peutics) plus three advanced platforms (radioligand ther-
apy (RLT), xRNA, and gene and cell therapy) that will play 
an important role in delivering transformative new 
medicines.
We focus on priority markets—US, Germany, China 
and Japan—which together account for most of the 
expected growth in global healthcare spending over the 
next five years. Although these are our priority markets, 
we maintain a strong presence in other markets world-
wide.
To support our focus areas, we have three strategic 
priorities:
•	 Deliver high-value medicines to accelerate growth. 
We aim to increase growth, driven by continued strong 
momentum in our existing portfolio of medicines—
including Entresto, Cosentyx, Kisqali, Kesimpta, 
­Scemblix, Pluvicto and Leqvio—and key upcoming 
launches. Over the longer term, we expect growth will 
come through delivering high-value medicines that sus-
tain and replace our existing growth drivers. Our R&D 
strategy focuses on an end-to-end approach, covering 
research, development and commercialization. We 
concentrate resources on priority programs to maxi-
mize early-stage potential and ensure effective late-
stage execution. We also focus on life-cycle manage-
ment by enhancing the evidence base for key brands.  
We increase our chances of discovering new medicines 
by collaborating with outside researchers and biotech 
companies. Our network consists of academic and 
industry alliances working on joint research and drug 
discovery.
•	 Embed operational excellence to deliver returns. In 
an increasingly competitive environment, we are sim-
plifying processes and reducing costs to become more 
efficient and effective in our decision-making and to 
free up resources for investment in new medicines. Our 
goal is to continue making attractive returns to share-
holders while creating value for patients, healthcare 
systems and society. In our manufacturing sites, we are 
expanding capacity in strategic focus areas such as 
biopharmaceuticals and advanced technology plat-
forms. For example, we are investing to expand our 
platform for RLT, a type of precision nuclear medicine 
that requires quick delivery to patients, since the activ-
ity of the radioisotope it contains diminishes over time. 
To ensure product quality, we maintain a quality man-
agement system for our medicines in compliance with 
requirements from health authorities and other regu-
lators. We are also switching more of our production 
to renewable energy and reducing the environmental 
footprint of our sites.
•	 Strengthen our foundations. We continue to invest in 
the foundations of our long-term success. We have 
made progress in strengthening our culture to attract 
and retain talent, while developing artificial intelligence 
capabilities across our value chain and continuing to 
build trust with stakeholders and society.

Company overview
Net sales from continuing operations were USD 50.3 bil-
lion, up 11% in USD reported terms and 12% measured 
in constant currencies (cc)1 to remove the impact of 
exchange rate movements. Net sales growth was driven 
by volume growth of 14 percentage points. Generic com-
petition had a negative impact of 2 percentage points 
and pricing was flat. Sales in the US were USD 21.1 bil-
lion (+18%) and in the rest of the world USD 29.2 billion 
(+6%, +8% cc).
Sales growth was mainly driven by continued strong 
performance from Entresto (USD 7.8 billion, +30%, +31% 
cc), Cosentyx (USD 6.1 billion, +23%, +25% cc), Kesimpta 
(USD 3.2 billion, +49%, +49% cc), Kisqali (USD 3.0 bil-
lion, +46%, +49% cc), Pluvicto (USD 1.4 billion, +42%, 
+42% cc) and Leqvio (USD 754 million, +112%, +114% cc), 
partly offset by erosion due to generic competition, 
mainly for Lucentis and Gilenya, and the Xiidra® divest-
ment. 
In the US (USD 21.1 billion, +18%), sales growth was 
mainly driven by Entresto, Cosentyx, Kesimpta, Kisqali, 
Pluvicto and Leqvio, partly offset by the Xiidra® divest-
ment and the impact of generic competition on Gilenya. 
In Europe (USD 15.6 billion, +4%, +5% cc), sales growth 
was mainly driven by Entresto, Kesimpta, Pluvicto and 
Kisqali, partly offset by erosion due to generic competi-
tion, mainly for Lucentis and Gilenya. Sales in emerging 
growth markets2 were USD 12.9 billion (+11%, +15% cc), 
including USD 3.9 billion of sales from China (+19%, +21% 
cc).
Operating income from continuing operations was 
USD 14.5 billion (+49%, +55% cc), mainly driven by higher 
net sales, lower impairments, amortization and

restructuring charges, partly offset by prior-year one-
time income from legal matters and higher R&D invest-
ments. Operating income margin was 28.9% of net sales, 
increasing 7.4 percentage points (+8.1 percentage points 
cc).
Net income from continuing operations was USD 11.9 
billion (+39%, +45% cc), mainly driven by higher operat-
ing income from continuing operations, partly offset by 
higher income taxes, mainly resulting from higher income 
before taxes from continuing operations in the current 
year and non-recurring tax benefits in the prior year. 
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was 
USD 5.92 (+43%, +49% cc), growing faster than net 
income, beneﬁting from lower weighted average number 
of shares outstanding.
Net cash flows from operating activities from con-
tinuing operations amounted to USD 17.6 billion, com-
pared with USD 14.2 billion in 2023. This increase was 
mainly driven by higher net income from continuing oper-
ations, adjusted for non-cash items and other adjust-
ments, including divestment gains, lower payments out 
of provisions and lower income taxes paid, mainly due 
to the timing of income tax payments, partly offset by 
unfavorable changes in working capital and higher net 
interest paid and other financial payments.
Free cash flow1 from continuing operations amounted 
to USD 16.3 billion (+24% USD), compared with USD 13.2 
billion in 2023, driven by higher net cash flows from oper-
ating activities from continuing operations. 
We also present our core results1, which exclude the 
impact of amortization of intangible assets, impairments, 
business acquisitions, divestments, and other significant 
items, including restructuring and related items, to help 
investors understand our underlying performance.
Core operating income from continuing operations 
was USD 19.5 billion (+19%, +22% cc), mainly driven by 
higher net sales, partly offset by higher R&D investments. 
Core operating income margin from continuing opera-
tions was 38.7% of net sales, increasing 2.7 percentage 
points (+3.3 percentage points cc).
Core net income from continuing operations was 
USD 15.8 billion (+17%, +21% cc), mainly due to higher 
core operating income. Core basic earnings per share 
from continuing operations was USD 7.81 (+21%, +24% 
cc), growing faster than core net income from continu-
ing operations, beneﬁting from lower weighted average 
number of shares outstanding. 
As the Sandoz spin-off was completed on October 
3, 2023, there were no operating results in 2024 related 
to discontinued operations. In 2023, discontinued oper-
ations net sales were USD 7.4 billion, operating income 
amounted to USD 265 million and net income from dis-
continued operations was USD 6.3 billion driven by the 
IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, non-taxable, net 
gain on distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG 
shareholders, which amounted to USD 5.9 billion.
Total Company net income was USD 11.9 billion in 
2024, compared with USD 14.9 billion in 2023 and basic 
EPS was USD 5.92 compared with USD 7.15 in prior year 
as the prior year included the IFRS Accounting Stan-
dards non-cash, non-taxable, net gain on distribution of 
Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders, which 
amounted to USD 5.9 billion. Net cash flows from oper-
ating activities for total Company amounted to USD 17.6 
billion and free cash flow amounted to USD 16.3 billion.

For the table providing the net sales from continuing 
operations by core therapeutic area and established 
brands for 2024 and 2023, see “Item 18. Financial state-
ments—Note 4. Revenues and geographic information.”
For information about the approved indications for 
certain products described, see “Item 4. Information on 
the Company—Item 4.B Business overview— Products.”
CARDIOVASCULAR, RENAL AND METABOLIC 
Net sales in the cardiovascular, renal and metabolic ther-
apeutic area were USD 8.6 billion (+34%, +36% cc), with 
sales growth mainly driven by Entresto.
Entresto (USD 7.8 billion, +30%, +31% cc) sustained 
robust, demand-led growth. In the US and Europe, 
Entresto penetration grew through the continued adop-
tion of guideline-directed medical therapy in heart fail-
ure. In China and Japan, Entresto volume growth was 
fueled by heart failure as well as hypertension. In the US, 
Novartis is in ANDA litigation with generic manufactur-
ers. Novartis successfully appealed to uphold the valid-
ity of its combination patent covering Entresto and com-
binations of sacubitril and valsartan, which expires in 
2025 (with pediatric exclusivity). Several generics have 
received final approval in the US. Novartis filed a lawsuit 
against FDA challenging the approval of one generic 
ANDA, which is now on appeal. Any US commercial 
launch of a generic Entresto product prior to the final 
outcome of the combination patent litigation, or ongoing 
litigations involving other patents or the FDA, may be at 
risk of later litigation developments. 
Leqvio (USD 0.8 billion, +112%, +114% cc) launch in 
the US and other markets is ongoing, delivering a med-
icine with effective and consistent LDL-C reduction in 
two maintenance doses per year. Focus remains on 
increased account and patient adoption and continuing 
medical education. Leqvio is registered in more than 105 
countries world-wide and commercially available in 78 
countries. Novartis obtained global rights to develop, 
manufacture and commercialize Leqvio under a license 
and 
collaboration 
agreement 
with 
Alnylam 
Pharmaceuticals. 
IMMUNOLOGY 
Net sales in the immunology therapeutic area reached 
USD 9.3 billion (+19%, +21% cc), with sales growth mainly 
driven by Cosentyx.
Cosentyx (USD 6.1 billion, +23%, +25% cc) sales grew 
mainly in the US, emerging growth markets and Europe, 
driven by strong demand from launches (including the 
HS indication and the IV formulation in the US) and vol-
ume growth in core indications (PsO, PsA, AS and nr-ax-
SpA). Since initial approval in 2015, Cosentyx has shown 
sustained efficacy and a robust safety profile, treating 
more than 1.7 million patients across eight indications.
Xolair (USD 1.6 billion, ex-US +12%, +15% cc) growth 
was driven mainly by emerging growth markets. Novartis 
co-promotes Xolair with Genentech in the US and shares 
a portion of revenue as operating income but does not 
record any US sales. 
Ilaris (USD 1.5 billion, +11%, +14% cc) sales grew 
across most regions, led by the US. Contributors to 
growth include strong performance in the Periodic Fever 
Syndromes and Still’s disease indications. 
NEUROSCIENCE 
Net sales in the neuroscience therapeutic area were USD 
4.8 billion (+30%, +31% cc), with sales growth mainly 
driven by Kesimpta.
Kesimpta (USD 3.2 billion, +49%, +49% cc) sales 
grew across all regions driven by increased demand and 
strong access. Kesimpta is a high efficacy B-cell therapy, 
with a favorable safety and tolerability profile and an 
at-home self-administration for a broad population of 
RMS patients. Kesimpta is now approved in 90 countries 
with more than 130,000 patients treated. 
Zolgensma (USD 1.2 billion, 0%, +2% cc) sales were 
stable (USD) and grew slightly (cc) compared with prior 
year, as it continues to treat mainly incident patients in 
established markets. Zolgensma is now approved in 58 
countries with more than 4,500 patients treated globally 
through clinical trials, early access programs and in the 
commercial setting. 
Aimovig (USD 0.3 billion, +17%, +18% cc) sales grew 
mainly in Europe driven by increased demand for migraine 
prevention. Novartis commercializes Aimovig ex-US and 
ex-Japan, while Amgen retains all rights in the US and in 
Japan.
ONCOLOGY 
Net sales in the oncology therapeutic area were USD 
14.7 billion (+15%, +16% cc), with sales growth mainly 
driven by Kisqali, Pluvicto, Scemblix and Jakavi.
Kisqali (USD 3.0 billion, +46%, +49% cc) sales grew 
strongly across all regions, with increasing recognition 
of the consistently demonstrated overall survival bene-
fit across all Ph3 clinical trials in HR+/ HER2- metastatic 
breast cancer (mBC), as well as Category 1 preferred 
NCCN guidelines recommendation and highest ESMO-
MCBS scores in both mBC and early breast cancer (eBC) 
indications. Kisqali was approved for eBC in September 
2024 in the US and November 2024 in the EU. In the 
fourth quarter, the Kisqali US eBC launch showed prom-
ising early uptake in line with the broad population of eBC 
patients, including those with node-negative disease, 
covered in the label. Novartis is in US ANDA litigation 
with generic manufacturers.
Promacta/Revolade (USD 2.2 billion, –2%, –1% cc) 
sales declined slightly following discontinued proactive 
promotion in most markets. 
Tafinlar + Mekinist (USD 2.1 billion, +7%, +9% cc) sales 
grew mainly in emerging growth markets, the US and 
Japan driven by demand in BRAF+ adjuvant melanoma, 
NSCLC, pediatric low-grade glioma, and tumor agnostic 
indications, while maintaining demand in the highly com-
petitive BRAF+ metastatic melanoma market. 
Jakavi (USD 1.9 billion, +13%, +15% cc) sales grew 
across all regions driven by strong demand in all indica-
tions. Incyte retains all rights to ruxolitinib (Jakafi®) in the 
US. 
Tasigna (USD 1.7 billion, –10%, –8% cc) sales declined 
across all regions due to lower demand and increasing 
competition. 
Pluvicto (USD 1.4 billion, +42%, +42% cc) sales grew 
in the US and Europe. Pluvicto is the only radioligand 
therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult 
patients with progressive, PSMA-positive metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer, who have already 
been treated with other anti-cancer treatments (ARPI 
and taxane-based chemotherapy). Pluvicto is now on the 
market in several ex-US countries. Novartis is in patent

litigation with a manufacturer developing a radiopharma-
ceutical to treat PSMA-positive prostate cancer. 
Lutathera (USD 0.7 billion, +20%, +20% cc) sales 
grew across all regions due to increased demand, and 
earlier line adoption (within indication) in the US and 
Japan. Novartis is in patent litigation with manufacturers 
having FDA applications referencing Lutathera. 
Scemblix (USD 0.7 billion, +67%, +68% cc) sales grew 
across all regions, demonstrating continued high unmet 
need for effective and tolerable treatment options for 
adult CML patients previously treated with two or more 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as well as initial uptake among 
early-line patients in the US following FDA accelerated 
approval in October 2024.
Piqray/Vijoice (USD 0.4 billion, –11%, –11% cc) sales 
declined mostly in the US due to increased competition. 
Kymriah (USD 0.4 billion, –13%, –12% cc) sales 
declined across most regions, partly offset by strong per-
formance in pediatric and young adult patients up to 25 
years of age with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(pALL) in the US, and follicular lymphoma indication 
uptake ex-US.
Fabhalta (USD 0.1 billion) launch continues in PNH 
globally, as well as in IgA nephropathy  in the US 
following FDA accelerated approval in this indication in 
August 2024.
ESTABLISHED BRANDS 
The established brands had net sales of USD 13.0 billion 
(–12%, –11% cc).
Sandostatin Group (USD 1.3 billion, –3%, –1% cc) 
sales declined slightly, primarily in the US, partly due to 
generics entry in the fourth quarter. 
Lucentis (USD 1.0 billion, ex-US –29%, –28% cc) sales 
declined in Europe, emerging growth markets, and 
Japan, mainly due to competition. 
Exforge Group (USD 0.7 billion, –1%, +2% cc) sales 
declined slightly (USD) and grew slightly (cc), with growth 
mainly in emerging growth markets. 
Galvus Group (USD 0.6 billion, –13%, –6% cc) sales 
declined mainly in Europe, primarily due to generic com-
petition, partly offset by growth in emerging growth mar-
kets. 
Diovan Group (USD 0.6 billion, –4%, 0% cc) sales 
declined (USD) and remained stable (cc), as a decline in 
the US offset growth primarily in emerging growth mar-
kets. 
Gilenya (USD 0.6 billion, –40%, –39% cc) sales 
declined due to competition, mainly in the US and Europe.

sales from continuing operations lower impairments, 
amortization and restructuring charges, partly offset by 
prior-year one-time income from legal matters and higher 
R&D investments. Operating income margin from con-
tinuing operations was 28.9% of net sales from continu-

The adjustments made to operating income from con-
tinuing operations to arrive at core operating income 
from continuing operations amounted to USD 5.0 billion 
(compared with USD 6.6 billion in the prior year). For 
more information, see “—Non-IFRS measures as defined 
by Novartis—2024 and 2023 reconciliation from IFRS 
Accounting Standards results to non-IFRS core results.”
Core operating income from continuing operations 
was USD 19.5 billion (+19%, +22% cc), mainly driven by 
higher net sales from continuing operations, partly off-
set by higher R&D investments. Core operating income 
margin from continuing operations was 38.7% of net 
sales from continuing operations, increasing 2.7 
percentage points (+3.3 percentage points cc). Core 
other revenue as a percentage of net sales from con-
tinuing operations increased by 0.1 percentage points

Research and exploratory development expenses 
increased by 11% (–10% cc) to USD 4.0 billion. Confirma-
tory development expenses amounted to USD 6.0 bil-
lion, decreasing by 22% (+22% cc) versus prior year 
mainly due to lower impairments from discontinuation of 
early stage development projects. Research and devel-
opment as a percentage of net sales from continuing

of net sales from continuing operations.
Total core research and development expenses 
amounted to USD 9.3 billion, increasing by 8% (–8% cc)

Interest expense and other financial income and 
expense
Interest expense amounted to USD 1.0 billion compared 
with USD 855 million in the prior year mainly due to an 
increase in financial debts. 
Other financial income and expense amounted to an 
income of USD 140 million, broadly in line with the pri-
or-year.
Income taxes
The tax rate was 12.5% compared with 6.0% in the prior 
year period. The current year tax rate was favorably 
impacted by the effect of changes in uncertain tax posi-
tions and other items that mostly offset. The prior year 
tax rate was favorably impacted by the effect of tax ben-
efits from the write-down of investments in subsidiaries, 
non-taxable net gains on unrealized foreign currency 
results, recognition of deferred tax assets on prior years 
tax loss carry-forwards, non-taxable income related to 
legal matters, and other items including impact of tax 
rate changes. Excluding these impacts, the current year 
tax rate would have been 15.0% compared with 15.3% in 
the prior year period. The decrease from the prior year 
was mainly the result of a change in profit mix, partially 
offset by the impact of a tax charge related to the expan-
sion of products included in the Swiss patent box regime, 
and the impact of a Pillar Two tax charge in Switzerland. 
Net income from continuing operations
Net income from continuing operations was USD 11.9 bil-
lion (+39%, +45% cc), mainly driven by higher operating 
income from continuing operations, partly offset by 
higher income taxes, mainly resulting from higher income 
before taxes from continuing operations in the current 
year and non-recurring tax benefits in the prior year.
Earnings per share from continuing operations
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was 
USD 5.92 (+43%, +49% cc), growing faster than net 
income from continuing operations, beneﬁting from 
lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.

Core interest expense and other financial income 
and expense
Core interest expense amounted to USD 1.0 billion com-
pared with USD 855 million in the prior year mainly due 
to an increase in financial debts. 
Core other financial income and expense amounted to 
an income of USD 295 million compared with an income of 
USD 430 million in the prior year, mainly due to lower inter-
est income and higher currency losses.
Core income taxes
The core tax rate (core taxes as a percentage of core 
income before tax) was 16.1% and 15.6% in the prior year. 
The increase from the prior year was mainly the result 
of a change in profit mix and the impact of a tax charge 
related to the expansion of products included in the 
Swiss patent box regime, and the impact of a Pillar Two 
tax charge in Switzerland. 
Core net income from continuing operations
Core net income from continuing operations was USD 
15.8 billion (+17%, +21% cc), mainly due to higher core 
operating income from continuing operations. 
Core earnings per share from continuing 
operations
Core basic earnings per share from continuing opera-
tions was USD 7.81 (+21%, +24% cc), growing faster than 
core net income from continuing operations, beneﬁting 
from lower weighted average number of shares out-
standing. 
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations include the Sandoz, generic 
pharmaceuticals and biosimilars division and certain cor-
porate activities attributable to Sandoz prior to the spin-off 
up to the distribution date of October 3, 2023 and certain 
other expenses related to the spin-off. Included in 2023 is 
also the IFRS Accounting Standards non-cash, non-tax-
able net gain on the distribution of Sandoz Group AG to 
Novartis AG shareholders of USD 5.9 billion, representing 
mainly the excess amount of the IFRS Accounting Stan-
dards distribution liability, which is the estimated fair value 
of the Sandoz business distributed to Novartis AG share-
holders, over the then carrying value of Sandoz business 
net assets. There were no operating results for 2024 
related to discontinued operations. 
In 2023, discontinued operations net sales were USD 
7.4 billion, operating income amounted to USD 265 mil-
lion and net income from discontinued operations was 
USD 6.3 billion driven by the IFRS Accounting Standards 
non-cash, non-taxable, net gain on distribution of Sandoz 
Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders, which amounted 
to USD 5.9 billion. 
For further information, see “Item 18. Financial State-
ments—Note 1. Accounting policies; Note 2. Significant 
acquisitions of businesses and spin-off of Sandoz busi-
ness—Distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG 
shareholders and —Note 29. Discontinued operations.” 
Total Company
Total Company net income was USD 11.9 billion in 2024, 
compared with USD 14.9 billion in 2023 and basic EPS 
was USD 5.92 compared to USD 7.15 in prior year as the 
prior year included the IFRS Accounting Standards non-
cash, non-taxable, net gain on distribution of Sandoz 
Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders, which amounted 
to USD 5.9 billion. Net cash flows from operating activi-
ties for total Company amounted to USD 17.6 billion and 
free cash flow amounted to USD 16.3 billion.

Factors affecting comparability of year-on-year results 
of operations
Significant transactions 
The comparability of the year-on-year results of our 
operations for the total Company can be significantly 
affected by acquisitions and divestments. As part of our 
long-term strategy to focus Novartis as a leading 
medicines company, we announced and/or completed 
several acquisitions and divestments during 2024 
and 2023.
A detailed description of significant transactions in 
2024 and 2023 can be found in “Item 18. Financial State-
ments—Note 2. Significant acquisitions of businesses 
and spin-off of Sandoz business.”
Internal control over financial reporting
The Company’s management has assessed the effec-
tiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The 
Company’s independent registered public accounting 
firm also issued an opinion on the effectiveness of inter-
nal control over financial reporting. Both the Company’s 
management and its independent registered public 
accounting firm concluded that the Company main-
tained, in all material respects, effective internal control 
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. For 
more information, see “Item 15. Controls and Proce-
dures.”
Approach to risk management
See “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employ-
ees—Item 6.C Board practices—Corporate gover-
nance—Information 
and 
control 
systems—Risk 
management” and “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 
28. Financial instruments – additional disclosures.”

 Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis
Novartis uses certain non-IFRS Accounting Standards 
metrics when measuring performance, especially when 
measuring current-year results against prior periods, 
including core results, constant currencies and free cash 
flow. These are referred to by Novartis as non-IFRS mea-
sures.
Despite the use of these measures by management 
in setting goals and measuring the Company’s perfor-
mance, these are non-IFRS measures that have no stan-
dardized meaning prescribed by IFRS Accounting Stan-
dards. As a result, such measures have limits in their 
usefulness to investors.
Because of their non-standardized definitions, the 
non-IFRS measures (unlike IFRS Accounting Standards 
measures) may not be comparable to the calculation of 
similar measures of other companies. These non-IFRS 
measures are presented solely to permit investors to 
more fully understand how the Company’s management 
assesses underlying performance. These non-IFRS 
measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a sub-
stitute for IFRS Accounting Standards measures, and 
should be viewed in conjunction with the consolidated 
financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS 
Accounting Standards.
As an internal measure of Company performance, 
these non-IFRS measures have limitations, and the Com-
pany’s performance management process is not solely 
restricted to these metrics.
Core results
The Company’s core results – including core operating 
income, core net income and core earnings per share – 
exclude fully the amortization and impairment charges 
of intangible assets, excluding software, net gains and 
losses on fund investments and equity securities valued 
at fair value through profit and loss, impact of IAS Stan-
dards 29 “Financial reporting in Hyperinflationary Econ-
omies” to other financial income and expense, and cer-
tain acquisition- and divestment-related items. The 
following items that exceed a threshold of USD 25 mil-
lion are also excluded: integration- and divestment-re-
lated income and expenses; divestment gains and losses; 
restructuring charges/releases and related items; 
legal-related items; impairments of property, plant and 
equipment, software, and financial assets, and income 
and expense items that management deems exceptional 
and that are or are expected to accumulate within the 
year to be over a USD 25 million threshold. 
Novartis believes that investor understanding of the 
Company’s performance is enhanced by disclosing core 
measures of performance, since core measures exclude 
items that can vary significantly from year to year, they 
enable better comparison of business performance 
across years. For this same reason, Novartis uses these 
core measures in addition to IFRS Accounting Standards 
measures and other measures as important factors in 
assessing the Company’s performance.
The following are examples of how these core measures 
are used:
•	 In addition to monthly reports containing financial infor-
mation prepared under IFRS Accounting Standards, 
senior management receives a monthly analysis incor-
porating these non-IFRS core measures.
•	 Annual budgets are prepared for both IFRS Account-
ing Standard measures and non-IFRS core measures. 
As an internal measure of Company performance, the 
core results measures have limitations, and the Compa-
ny’s performance management process is not solely 
restricted to these metrics. A limitation of the core results 
measures is that they provide a view of the Company’s 
operations without including all events during a period, 
such as the effects of an acquisition, divestment, or 
amortization/impairments of intangible assets, impair-
ments to property, plant and equipment and restructur-
ings and related items.
Constant currencies
Changes in the relative values of non-US currencies to 
the US dollar can affect the Company’s financial results 
and financial position. To provide additional information 
that may be useful to investors, including changes in 
sales volume, we present information about our net sales 
and various values relating to operating and net income 
that are adjusted for such foreign currency effects.
Constant currency calculations have the goal of elim-
inating two exchange rate effects so that an estimate 
can be made of underlying changes in the consolidated 
income statement excluding the impact of fluctuations 
in exchanges rates:
•	 The impact of translating the income statements of 
consolidated entities from their non-USD functional 
currencies to USD
•	 The impact of exchange rate movements on the major 
transactions of consolidated entities performed in cur-
rencies other than their functional currency.
We calculate constant currency measures by translating 
the current year’s foreign currency values for sales and 
other income statement items into USD (excluding the 
IAS Standards 29 “Financial Reporting in Hyperinflation-
ary Economies” adjustments to the local currency 
income statements of subsidiaries operating in hyperin-
flationary economies), using the average exchange rates 
from the prior year and comparing them to the prior year 
values in USD.
We use these constant currency measures in evalu-
ating the Company’s performance, since they may assist 
us in evaluating our ongoing performance from year to 
year. However, in performing our evaluation, we also con-
sider equivalent measures of performance that are not 
affected by changes in the relative value of currencies.

Growth rate calculation
For ease of understanding, Novartis uses a sign conven-
tion for its growth rates such that a reduction in operat-
ing expenses or losses compared with the prior year is 
shown as a positive growth.
Free cash flow
Novartis defines free cash flow as net cash flows from 
operating activities less purchases of property, plant and 
equipment. Management believes that this definition pro-
vides a performance measure that focuses on core oper-
ating activities, and also excludes items that can vary 
significantly from year to year, thereby enabling better 
comparison of business performance across years.
Free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure, which means 
it should not be interpreted as a measure determined 
under IFRS Accounting Standards. Free cash flow is not 
intended to be a substitute measure for net cash flows 
from operating activities as determined under IFRS 
Accounting Standards. Free cash flow is presented as 
additional information because management believes it 
is a useful supplemental indicator of the Company’s 
ability to operate without reliance on additional borrow-
ing or use of existing cash. Free cash flow is a measure 
of the net cash generated that is available for investment 
in strategic opportunities, returning to shareholders and 
for debt repayment. 
Additional information
Net debt
Novartis calculates net debt as current financial debts 
and derivative financial instruments plus non-current 
financial debt less cash and cash equivalents and mar-
ketable securities, commodities, time deposits and deriv-
ative financial instruments.
Net debt is presented as additional information 
because it sets forth how management monitors net debt 
or liquidity and management believes it is a useful sup-
plemental indicator of the Company’s ability to pay divi-
dends, to meet financial commitments, and to invest in 
new strategic opportunities, including strengthening its 
balance sheet. 
For the table that shows the Company’s net debt, see 
“— Item 5.B Liquidity and capital resources — Company 
liquidity, financial debts and net debt.”

amortization of acquired rights to scientific infrastructure and technologies
2	Impairments: cost of goods sold and research and development include net impairment charges related to intangible assets; other income and other expense include net 
impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment; other expense also includes a goodwill impairment
3	Acquisition or divestment of businesses and related items, including integration charges: research and development and other expense include integration cost charges; other 
income includes divestment gains; other income and other expense include transitional service-fee income and expenses related to the Sandoz distribution, and adjustments to 
provisions
4	Other items: cost of goods sold, selling, general and administration, research and development, other income and other expense include restructuring income and charges related 
to the initiative to implement a new streamlined organizational model, the company-wide rationalization of manufacturing sites and other net restructuring charges and related 
items; cost of goods sold and research and development also include contingent consideration adjustments; other income and other expense include adjustments to environmental 
provisions, fair value adjustments on financial assets, a fair value adjustment on a contingent receivable and other costs and items; other income also includes divestment gains; 
other expense includes legal related items and a curtailment adjustment; loss from associated companies includes a divestment adjustment related to the sale of an investment in 
associated companies; other financial income and expense includes the impact of IAS Standards 29 “Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies” for subsidiaries 
operating in hyperinflationary economies, currency devaluation losses, an adjustment related to the gain on sale of financial assets and interests on tax related items
5	Taxes on the adjustments between IFRS  Accounting Standards and core results, for each item included in the adjustment, take into account the tax rate that will finally be 
applicable to the item based on the jurisdiction where the adjustment will finally have a tax impact. Generally, this results in amortization and impairment of intangible assets other 
than goodwill and acquisition-related restructuring and integration items having a full tax impact. There is usually a tax impact on other items, although this is not always the case 
for items arising from legal settlements in certain jurisdictions. Adjustments related to income from associated companies are recorded net of any related tax effect. Due to these 
factors and the differing effective tax rates in the various jurisdictions, the tax on the total adjustments of USD 5.1 billion to arrive at the core results before tax amounts to USD 1.3 
billion and the average tax rate on the total adjustments was 25.6%.
6	Core earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing core net income attributable to shareholders of Novartis AG by the weighted average number of shares used in the basic 
EPS calculation outstanding in a reporting period.

financial income and expense includes the impact of IAS Standards 29 “Financial reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies” for subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary 
economies and foreign exchange losses
5	Taxes on the adjustments between IFRS Accounting Standards and core results, for each item included in the adjustment, take into account the tax rate that is applicable to the 
item based on the jurisdiction where the adjustment has a tax impact. Generally, this results in amortization and impairment of intangible assets and acquisition-related 
restructuring and integration items having a full tax impact. There is usually a tax impact on other items, although this is not always the case for items arising from legal settlements 
in certain jurisdictions.  Due to these factors and the differing statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions, the tax on the total adjustments of USD 6.8 billion to arrive at the core 
results before tax amounts to USD 1.9 billion and the average tax rate on the adjustments was 28.4%.
6	For details on discontinued operations reconciliation from IFRS  Accounting Standards net income to core net income refer to page 55.
7	 Core earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing core net income attributable to shareholders of Novartis AG by the weighted average number of shares used in the basic 
EPS calculation outstanding in a reporting period.

4	Taxes on the adjustments between IFRS Accounting Standards and core results, for each item included in the adjustment, take into account the tax rate that will finally be 
applicable to the item based on the jurisdiction where the adjustment will finally have a tax impact. Generally, this results in amortization and impairment of intangible assets and 
acquisition-related restructuring and integration items having a full tax impact. There is usually a tax impact on other items, although this is not always the case for items arising 
from legal settlements in certain jurisdictions. Adjustments related to income from associated companies are recorded net of any related tax effect. Due to these factors and the 
differing effective tax rates in the various jurisdictions, the tax on the total adjustments of USD 926 million to arrive at the core results before tax amounts to USD 459 million and 
the average tax rate on the adjustments was 49.5%.
5	Core earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing core net income attributable to shareholders of Novartis AG by the weighted average number of shares used in the basic 
EPS calculation outstanding in a reporting period.

Cash flow
Net cash flows from operating activities from continuing 
operations amounted to USD 17.6 billion, compared with 
USD 14.2 billion in 2023. This increase was mainly driven 
by higher net income from continuing operations, 
adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments, 
including divestment gains, lower payments out of pro-
visions and lower income taxes paid, mainly due to the 
timing of income tax payments, partly offset by unfavor-
able changes in working capital and higher net interest 
paid and other financial payments.
In 2023, net cash flows from operating activities from 
discontinued operations amounted to USD 0.2 billion 
(2024: nil). 
Net cash outflows used in investing activities from 
continuing operations amounted to USD 7.5 billion, com-
pared with USD 6.7 billion net cash inflows in 2023.
In the current year, net cash outflows used in invest-
ing activities from continuing operations were mainly 
driven by USD 3.9 billion net cash outflows for acquisi-
tions and divestments of businesses, including the acqui-
sition of Kate Therapeutics for USD 0.4 billion; the acqui-
sition of Mariana Oncology for USD 1.0 billion (USD 1.04 
billion, net of cash acquired of USD 80 million); and the 
acquisition of MorphoSys for USD 2.3 billion (USD 2.5 
billion, net of cash acquired of USD 0.2 billion). In addi-
tion, the cash outflows for purchases of intangible assets 
amounted to USD 2.4 billion; purchases of property, plant 
and equipment amounted to USD 1.4 billion; purchases 
of financial assets amounted to USD 0.2 billion and net 
purchases of marketable securities, commodities and 
time deposits amounted to USD 0.7 billion. These cash 
outflows were partly offset by cash inflows of USD 1.0 
billion from the sale of financial assets (including USD 
0.7 billion proceeds from the sale of Sandoz Group AG 
shares by consolidated foundations); and by USD 0.2 bil-
lion from the sale of intangible assets and property, plant 
and equipment. 
In 2023, net cash inflows from investing activities 
from continuing operations of USD 6.7 billion  were driven 
by the net proceeds of USD 10.6 billion from the sale of 
marketable securities, commodities and time deposits; 
USD 2.0 billion from the sale of intangible assets (includ-
ing USD 1.75 billion cash proceeds from the divestment 
of the ‘front of eye’ ophthalmology assets to Bausch + 
Lomb); USD 0.3 billion from the sale of financial assets; 
and USD 0.2 billion from the sale of property, plant and 
equipment (including proceeds from the sale and lease-
back of real estate). These cash inflows were partly off-
set by cash outflows of USD 3.6 billion for acquisitions 
and divestments of businesses, net (including the acqui-
sition of Chinook Therapeutics for USD 3.1 billion, net of 
cash acquired of USD 0.1 billion, and the acquisition of 
DTx for USD 0.5 billion, net of cash acquired of USD 0.1 
billion); USD 1.7 billion for purchases of intangible assets; 
USD 1.1 billion for purchases of property, plant and equip-
ment; and USD 0.1 billion for purchases of financial 
assets.
In 2023, net cash outflows used in investing activities 
from discontinued operations amounted to USD 1.1 bil-
lion (2024: nil). 
Net cash outflows used in financing activities from 
continuing operations amounted to USD 11.7 billion, com-
pared with USD 17.6 billion in 2023. 
In the current year, net cash outflows used in financ-
ing activities from continuing operations were mainly 
driven by USD 8.3 billion for net treasury share transac-
tions; USD 7.6 billion for the dividend payment; the USD 
2.15 billion repayment of a US dollar bond at maturity, 
and the USD 0.3 billion repayments of other current 
financial debts. Cash outflows for MorphoSys shares 
purchased outside the Offer amounted to USD 0.3 bil-
lion, which included a USD 0.2 billion payment to the for-
mer remaining minority shareholders in connection with 
the “squeeze-out.” These cash outflows were partly off-
set by cash inflows from the issuance of bonds totaling

USD 6.1 billion (Swiss franc denominated bonds with a 
notional amount of CHF 2.2 billion, equivalent to USD 2.5 
billion, and US dollar denominated bonds with a notional 
amount of USD 3.7 billion). The change in current finan-
cial debts resulted in net cash inflows of USD 1.0 billion.
In 2023, net cash outflows used in financing activi-
ties from continuing operations of USD 17.6 billion were 
mainly driven by USD 8.6 billion for net treasury share 
transactions; USD 7.3 billion for the dividend payment; 
USD 2.2 billion for the repayment of two EUR denomi-
nated bonds (notional amounts of EUR 1.25 billion and 
of EUR 0.75 billion) at maturity. Payments of lease liabil-
ities amounted to USD 0.3 billion. These cash outflows 
were partly offset by cash inflows of USD 0.5 billion from 
the net increase in current financial debts.
In 2023, net cash inflows from financing activities 
from discontinued operations amounted to USD 3.3 bil-
lion (2024: nil).

discontinued operations, less purchases of property, plant and equipment by discontinued operations of USD 219 million.
Free cash flow from continuing operations amounted to 
USD 16.3 billion (+24% USD), compared with USD 13.2 
billion in 2023, driven by higher net cash flows from oper-
ating activities from continuing operations.
For the total Company, free cash flow amounted to 
USD 16.3 billion, compared with USD 13.2 billion in 2023.

Assets
Total non-current assets of USD 72.5 billion increased 
by USD 3.1 billion compared with December 31, 2023.
Intangible assets other than goodwill were broadly in 
line with December 31, 2023, mainly as the impact of the 
business acquisitions of Kate Therapeutics, Mariana 
Oncology, and MorphoSys and additions, were offset by 
amortization, impairments and unfavorable currency 
translation effects. 
Goodwill increased by USD 1.4 billion mainly due to 
the impact of the business acquisitions of Kate Thera-
peutics, Mariana Oncology and MorphoSys, partially off-
set by an impairment and unfavorable currency transla-
tion effects.
Financial assets decreased by USD 0.6 billion mainly 
due to the sale of Sandoz Group AG shares by consoli-
dated foundations. 
Other non-current assets increased by USD 2.3 bil-
lion mainly due the increase of prepaid post-employment 
benefit plans. This increase is due to the pension plans 
in Switzerland not being required to continue to apply 
the IFRS Standards limitation on recognition of fund sur-
plus (the asset ceiling) as at December 31, 2024.
Property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, 
deferred tax assets and investments in associated com-
panies were broadly in line with December 31, 2023.
Total current assets of USD 29.7 billion decreased 
by USD 0.8 billion compared with December 31, 2023.

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by USD 1.9 bil-
lion mainly as cash generated through operating activi-
ties of USD 17.6 billion and net proceeds from changes 
in ﬁnancial debts of USD 4.7 billion, were offset by the 
USD 7.6 billion dividend payment, USD 8.3 billion for net 
purchases of treasury shares, USD 3.9 billion mainly for 
the business acquisitions of Kate Therapeutics, Mariana 
Oncology and MorphoSys, USD 3.6 billion for net pur-
chases of property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets, and other net cash outflows from investing and 
financing activities and currency effects of USD 0.8 bil-
lion.
Marketable securities, commodities, time deposits 
and derivative ﬁnancial instruments increased by USD 
1.0 billion. Trade receivables increased by USD 0.3 bil-
lion, mainly driven by the increase in net sales and other 
current assets increased by USD 0.4 billion. Income tax 
receivables decreased by USD 0.3 billion. Inventories 
were broadly in line with December 31, 2023.
We consider our provisions for doubtful trade receiv-
ables to be adequate. We particularly monitor the level 
of trade receivables in countries deemed to have an ele-
vated credit risk. We consider macroeconomic environ-
ment, historical experience, country and political risks, 
in addition to other relevant information when assessing 
risk. These risk factors are monitored regularly to deter-
mine any adjustments to risk classification. The majority 
of the past due trade receivables from elevated credit 
risk countries are due from local governments or from 
government-funded entities. Deteriorating credit, eco-
nomic conditions and other factors in these elevated 
credit risk countries have resulted in, and may continue 
to result in an increase in the average time that it takes 
to collect these trade receivables and may require the 
Company to re-evaluate the expected credit loss amount 
of these trade receivables in future periods. As at Decem-
ber 31, 2024, amounts past due for more than one year 
were not significant in elevated credit risk countries.
For a table showing an overview of the aging analy-
sis of total trade receivables and the total amount of the 
provision for doubtful trade receivables as at December 
31, 2024, and 2023, see “Item 18. Financial Statements—
Note 15. Trade receivables.”
There is also a risk that certain countries could 
devalue their currency. Currency exposures are 
described in more detail in “—Effects of currency fluctu-
ations.”

Total non-current liabilities of USD 29.4 billion increased 
by USD 2.6 billion compared with December 31, 2023.
Non-current ﬁnancial debts increased by USD 2.9 
billion mainly due to the issuance of Swiss franc denom-
inated bonds of USD 2.5 billion (notional amount of CHF 
2.2 billion), the issuance of US dollar denominated bonds 
with a notional amount of USD 3.7 billion and ﬁnancial 
debts acquired through the MorphoSys business acqui-
sition of USD 0.6 billion, partly offset by the reclassiﬁca-
tion of USD 3.3 billion from non-current to current ﬁnan-
cial debts consisting of two US dollar denominated 
bonds with notional amount of USD 2.8 billion and a 
Swiss franc denominated bond of notional amount of 
CHF 0.5 billion all maturing in 2025.
Provisions and other non-current liabilities decreased 
by USD 0.4 billion. Non-current lease liabilities and 
deferred tax liabilities were broadly in line with Decem-
ber 31, 2023.
Total current liabilities of USD 28.7 billion increased 
by USD 2.3 billion compared with December 31, 2023.
Current ﬁnancial debts and derivative ﬁnancial instru-
ments increased by USD 2.1 billion compared with 
December 31, 2023, mainly due to the issuance of com-
mercial paper notes under the US commercial paper pro-
gram and the reclassiﬁcation of USD 3.3 billion from 
non-current to current ﬁnancial debts consisting of two 
US dollar denominated bonds with notional amount of 
USD 2.8 billion and a Swiss franc denominated bond of 
notional amount of CHF 0.5 billion all maturing in 2025, 
partly offset by the repayment of a US dollar bond at 
maturity of USD 2.15 billion.
Trade payables decreased by USD 0.4 billion. Provi-
sions and other current liabilities increased by USD 0.9 
billion mainly driven by the increase in provisions for 
deductions from revenue. Current income tax liabilities 
decreased by USD 0.3 billion. Current lease liabilities 
were broadly in line with December 31, 2023.
In our key countries, Switzerland and the United 
States, assessments have been agreed by the tax author-
ities up to 2020 in Switzerland and up to 2016 in the 
United States. 
Novartis believes that its total provisions are ade-
quate based upon currently available information. How-
ever, given the inherent difficulties in estimating these 
liabilities, Novartis may incur additional costs beyond the 
amounts provided. Management believes that such addi-
tional amounts, if any, would not be material to the Com-
pany’s financial condition but could be material to the 
results of operations or cash flows in a given period.
Equity
The Company’s equity decreased by USD 2.6 billion to 
USD 44.1 billion compared with December 31, 2023. 
This decrease was mainly driven by the net income 
of USD 11.9 billion, actuarial gains from defined benefit 
plans of USD 2.0 billion (mainly due to Swiss pension 
plans not being required to apply the asset ceiling in 
2024) and favorable impact from equity-based compen-
sation of USD 1.1 billion being more than offset by the 
purchase of treasury shares of USD 8.5 billion, the 
cash-dividend to Novartis AG shareholders of USD 7.6 
billion and unfavorable currency translation effects of 
USD 1.6 billion.

In 2024, Novartis repurchased a total of 77.5 million 
shares for USD 8.3 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange 
second trading line. These purchases included 68.8 mil-
lion shares (USD 7.3 billion) under the up-to USD 15 bil-
lion share buyback announced in July 2023 (with up to 
USD 5.4 billion still to be executed). In addition, 8.7 mil-
lion shares (USD 1.0 billion) were repurchased to miti-
gate the impact of share deliveries under the equi-
ty-based 
compensation 
plans 
for 
employees. 
Furthermore, 1.2 million shares (equity value of USD 0.1 
billion) were repurchased from employees. In the same 
period, 9.8 million shares (equity value of USD 1.1 billion) 
were delivered as a result of share deliveries related to 
employee equity-based compensation plans. Conse-
quently, the total number of shares outstanding 
decreased by 68.9 million versus December 31, 2023. 
These treasury share transactions resulted in an equity 
decrease of USD 7.4 billion and a net cash outflow of 
USD 8.3 billion.
In 2023, Novartis repurchased a total of 87.5 million 
shares for USD 8.4 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange 
second trading line. These repurchases included 52.8 
million shares (USD 4.9 billion) under the USD 15 billion 
share buyback (announced in December 2021 and com-
pleted in June 2023) and 23.0 million shares (USD 2.3 
billion) under the new up-to USD 15 billion share buyback 
announced in July 2023. In addition, 11.7 million shares 
(USD 1.2 billion) were repurchased to mitigate the impact 
of share deliveries under the equity-based compensa-
tion plans for employees. Furthermore, 1.6 million shares 
(equity value of USD 0.1 billion) were repurchased from 
employees. In the same period, 13.5 million shares (equity 
value of USD 1.1 billion) were delivered as a result of 
options exercised and share deliveries related to the 
equity-based compensation plans for employees. Con-
sequently, the total number of shares outstanding 
decreased by 75.6 million versus December 31, 2022. 
These treasury share transactions resulted in an equity 
decrease of USD 7.4 billion and a net cash outflow of 
USD 8.6 billion.
Treasury shares
As at December 31, 2024, our holding of treasury shares 
amounted to 214.9 million shares, or approximately 10% 
of the total number of issued shares. Approximately 86.0 
million treasury shares were held in entities that restrict 
their availability for use.
As at December 31, 2023, our holding of treasury 
shares amounted to 233.5 million shares, or approxi-
mately 10% of the total number of issued shares. Approx-
imately 93.8 million treasury shares were held in entities 
that restrict their availability for use.

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in US 
dollars. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rates 
between the US dollar and other currencies can have a 
significant effect on both the Company’s results of oper-
ations as well as the reported value of our assets, liabil-
ities and cash flows. This in turn may significantly affect 
reported earnings (both positively and negatively) and 
the comparability of period-to-period results of opera-
tions.
For purposes of our consolidated balance sheets, we 
translate assets and liabilities denominated in other cur-
rencies into US dollars at the prevailing market exchange 
rates as of the relevant balance sheet date. For purposes 
of the Company’s consolidated income and cash flow 
statements, revenue, expense and cash flow items in 
local currencies are translated into US dollars at aver-
age exchange rates prevailing during the relevant period. 
As a result, even if the amounts or values of these items 
remain unchanged in the respective local currency, 
changes in exchange rates have an impact on the 
amounts or values of these items in our consolidated 
financial statements.
Because our expenditure in Swiss francs is signifi-
cantly higher than our revenue in Swiss francs, volatility 
in the value of the Swiss franc can have a significant 
impact on the reported value of our earnings, assets and 
liabilities, and the timing and extent of such volatility can 
be difficult to predict. 
The Company manages its global currency exposure 
by engaging in hedging transactions where management 
deems appropriate, after taking into account the natural 
hedging afforded by our global business activity. In 2024 
and 2023, we entered into various contracts that change 
in value with movements in foreign exchange rates, to 
preserve the value of assets, commitments and expected 
transactions. We use forward contracts and foreign cur-
rency options to hedge. For more information on how 
these transactions affect our consolidated financial 
statements and on how foreign exchange rate exposure 
is managed, see “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 1. 
Accounting policies,” “Item 18. Financial Statements—
Note 5. Interest expense and other financial income and 
expense,” “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 15. Trade 
receivables,” “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 27.

The Company’s net debt as at December 31, 2024, 
increased to USD 16.1 billion, compared with USD 10.2 
billion as at December 31, 2023.
Total financial debts amounted to USD 29.6 billion as 
at December 31, 2024, compared with USD 24.6 billion 
as at December 31, 2023. Non-current ﬁnancial debts 
increased by USD 2.9 billion mainly due to the issuance 
of Swiss franc denominated bonds of USD 2.5 billion 
(notional amount of CHF 2.2 billion), the issuance of US 
dollar denominated bonds with a notional amount of USD 
3.7 billion and ﬁnancial debts acquired through the Mor-
phoSys business acquisition of USD 0.6 billion, partly 
offset by the reclassiﬁcation of USD 3.3 billion from 
non-current to current ﬁnancial debts consisting of two 
US dollar denominated bonds with notional amount of 
USD 2.8 billion and a Swiss franc denominated bond of 
notional amount of CHF 0.5 billion all maturing in 2025.
Current ﬁnancial debts and derivative ﬁnancial instru-
ments increased by USD 2.1 billion compared with 
December 31, 2023, mainly due to the issuance of com-
mercial paper notes under the US commercial paper pro-
gram and the reclassiﬁcation of USD 3.3 billion from 
non-current to current ﬁnancial debts consisting of two 
US dollar denominated bonds with notional amount of 
USD 2.8 billion and a Swiss franc denominated bond of 
notional amount of CHF 0.5 billion all maturing in 2025, 
partly offset by the repayment of a US dollar bond at 
maturity of USD 2.15 billion.
Novartis has a US commercial paper program under 
which it can issue up to USD 9.0 billion in the aggregate 
of unsecured commercial paper notes. Novartis also has 
a Japanese commercial paper program under which it 
can issue up to JPY 150 billion (approximately USD 1.0 
billion) of unsecured commercial paper notes. Commer-
cial paper notes totaling USD 4.1 billion under these two 
programs were outstanding as at December 31, 2024 
(2023: USD 3.3 billion).
In May 2024, Novartis replaced its existing USD 6.0 
billion credit facility with a syndicate of banks (which was 
undrawn at its replacement date and December 31, 2023 
and had a maturity date of September 2025) with a new 
USD 6.0 billion credit facility with a syndicate of banks. 
This credit facility is intended to be used as a backstop 
for the US commercial paper program. This facility 
matures in May 2029, and was undrawn as at December 
31, 2024.
Total liquidity decreased to USD 13.5 billion com-
pared with USD 14.4 billion as at December 31, 2023. 
As of year-end 2024, Moody’s Ratings rated the Com-
pany Aa3 for long-term maturities and P-1 for short-term 
maturities and S&P Global Ratings rated the company 
AA- for long-term maturities and A-1+ for short-term 
maturities.

Bonds 
In May 2024, a 10-year US dollar denominated bond of 
USD 2.15 billion with a coupon of 3.40% was repaid at 
maturity.
In June 2024, five Swiss franc denominated bonds 
totaling CHF 2.2 billion were issued: a 3-year bond of 
CHF 650 million with a coupon of 1.60%, a 7-year bond 
of CHF 435 million with a coupon of 1.65%, a 10-year 
bond of CHF 645 million with a coupon of 1.75%, a 16-year 
bond of CHF 280 million with a coupon of 1.85% and a 
25-year bond of CHF 190 million with a coupon of 1.85%.
In September 2024, four US dollar denominated 
bonds totaling USD 3.70 billion were issued: a 5-year 
bond of USD 1.00 billion with a coupon of 3.80%, a 7-year 
bond of USD 0.85 billion with a coupon of 4.00%, a 
10-year bond of USD 1.10 billion with a coupon of 4.20% 
and a 30-year bond of USD 0.75 billion with a coupon of 
4.70%.
In August 2023, a 5-year EUR denominated bond of 
EUR 750 million with a coupon of 0.50% was repaid at 
maturity.
In September 2023, a 7-year EUR denominated bond 
of EUR 1.25 billion with a coupon of 0.125% was repaid 
at maturity.
Liquidity/short-term funding
The Company’s liquidity amounted to USD 13.5 billion as 
at December 31, 2024, compared with USD 14.4 billion 
as at December 31, 2023. Total non-current and current 
ﬁnancial debts, including derivatives, amounted to USD 
29.6 billion as at December 31, 2024, compared with USD 
24.6 billion as at December 31, 2023.  
The debt/equity ratio increased to 0.67:1 as at Decem-
ber 31, 2024, compared with 0.53:1 as at December 31, 
2023. The net debt increased to USD 16.1 billion as at 
December 31, 2024, compared with USD 10.2 billion as 
at December 31, 2023.
We continuously track our liquidity position and 
asset/liability profile. This involves modeling cash flow 
maturity profiles based on both historical experiences 
and contractual expectations to project our liquidity 
requirements. We seek to preserve prudent liquidity and 
funding capabilities. We are confident that we have suf-
ficient liquidity to support our normal business activities 
for the foreseeable future.
Certain countries have legal or economic restrictions 
on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Com-
pany in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances, 
but these restrictions do not have an impact on the abil-
ity of the Company to meet its cash obligations. 
We are not aware of any significant demands to 
change the level of liquidity needed to support our nor-
mal business activities. We make use of various borrow-
ing facilities provided by several financial institutions. We 
also successfully issued various bonds in previous years 
and raised funds through our commercial paper pro-
grams.
The maturity schedule of our net debt can be found 
in “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 28. Financial 
instruments – Additional disclosures—Nature and extent 
of risks arising from financial instruments—Liquidity risk.”
Material contractual obligations and commitments
The Company’s material contractual obligations and 
commitments, entered into from time to time, consist of 
the following: 
•	 Non-current financial debt, including current portion (see 
“Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 19. Non-current 
financial debt”). For the table showing the maturity 
schedule of our current and non-current financial debt, 
see “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 28. Financial 
instruments—additional disclosures—Nature and extent 
of risks arising from financial instruments— Liquidity risk”; 
•	 Leases on assets used in operations entered into in 
the ordinary course of business (see “Item 18. Finan-
cial Statements— Note 10. Right-of-use assets and 
lease liabilities”); 
•	 Long-term research and development agreements with 
various institutions and pharmaceutical companies 
related to intangible assets. These agreements provide 
for potential milestone payments by Novartis, which 
are dependent on successful clinical development, or 
meeting specified sales targets, or other conditions 
that are specified in the agreements (see “Item 18. 
Financial Statements—Note 27. Commitments and 
contingent liabilities—Research and development 
commitments”);
•	 Commitments related to the acquisition of businesses 
and interests in intellectual property focused on key 
disease areas and indications that the Company 
expects to be growth drivers in the future (see “Item 
18. Financial Statements—Note 27. Commitments and 
contingent Liabilities—Other commitments”). In addi-
tion, certain business acquisition arrangements include 
contingent payments, which the shareholders of the 
acquired company are eligible to receive upon the 
achievement of specified milestones. For the table 
showing the maturity schedule of contingent consid-
eration liabilities, see “Item 18. Financial Statements—
Note 28. Financial instruments—additional disclo-
sures—Nature and extent of risks arising from financial 
instruments—Liquidity risk”;
•	 Unfunded independent pension and other post-employ-
ment benefit plans (see “Item 18. Financial Statements –

6.B Compensation
Dear shareholder, 
On behalf of the Compensation Committee of Novartis, 
I am pleased to present our 2024 Compensation Report.
2024 company performance
Novartis delivered an excellent performance in 2024, 
driven by sales growth in key brands and more cost-­
effective operations. Compared with the prior year, net 
sales from continuing operations increased by 12% mea-
sured in constant currencies (cc), core operating income 
increased by 22% (cc) and free cash flow increased by 
USD 3.1 billion. Sales growth was mainly driven by 
Entresto, Cosentyx, Kesimpta, and Kisqali. The Compa-
ny’s performance led to two guidance upgrades for net 
sales and three for core operating income. 
The compensation of the members of the Executive 
Committee of Novartis (ECN) is largely determined by 
performance evaluations conducted on both a short-
term basis through the Annual Incentive and a long-term 
basis via the Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP).
As an innovative medicines company, we consider 
innovation core to the value we bring to society. Innova-
tion and certain ESG targets (e.g., access to medicines) 
are included in the Annual Incentive targets of all Exec-
utive Committee members. There are further innovation 
milestones which comprise 25% of the LTPP perfor-
mance measurement. In 2024, our innovation highlights 
included the approval of Fabhalta in EU, China and Japan 
for adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglo-
binuria (PNH), as well as in the US for adult patients with 
immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). We also received 
accelerated approval in the US for Scemblix for newly 
diagnosed patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) 
and Kisqali was approved in the EU and US to reduce the 
risk of recurrence in people with early breast cancer.
2024 realized compensation 
The company’s performance in 2024 resulted in a total 
realized compensation for the CEO of CHF 19 165 899, 
of which 88.5% was made up of variable components, 
which comprised an Annual Incentive at 160% of target 
and a 2022-2024 LTPP at 158% of target. The LTPP rep-
resents the largest component of the realized compen-
sation. 
The 2022-2024 LTPP cycle delivered strong results 
versus target, with both third-party sales CAGR (com-
pound annual growth rate) and core operating income 
CAGR (both in cc) exceeding the level required for a max-
imum payout. Three-year sales performance from growth 
brands Entresto, Pluvicto, Kesimpta and Kisqali, all con-
siderably exceeded expectations. Our bottom line was 
further strengthened through savings generated by our 
organizational transformation. Innovation performance 
was solid, as evidenced by the advances listed above. 
Our share price performance and year-on-year dividend 
increases resulted in a total return to shareholders of 
54% over the performance cycle which ranked 5th out 
of our 15 global healthcare peer companies (including 
Novartis). In addition, the 2022-2024 LTPP cycle payout 
accrued a 15.5% increase in share price between grant 
and vesting. In line with our plan rules, an additional two-
year holding period applies for the CEO (and CFO) 
vested shares (i.e. until January 2027). The Board of 
Directors did not make any discretionary adjustments to 
the incentive outcomes. 
The chart below illustrates the strong correlation 
between the LTPP payout over the past five years and 
the three-year total shareholder return (TSR), demon-
strating consistent alignment with shareholders’ experi-
ence.
HISTORIC LTPP PAYOUT VERSUS TSR
The performance outcomes described above also con-
tributed to the total aggregated realized compensation 
of the other ECN members which was CHF 56 580 414.
For further details on the realized compensation, 
including a comparison with 2023 realized compensa-
tion, see “—CEO and Executive Committee 2024 real-
ized compensation.”
Executive Committee compensation system 
changes
At the beginning of 2024, the Board of Directors incor-
porated significant changes into our executive compen-
sation system, which were shaped with input from our 
shareholders as described in detail in last year’s Com-
pensation Report. These changes were strongly sup-
ported at the 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM), for 
which I would like to express my appreciation. We are 
confident that the changes place us in a better position 
to attract and retain the best talent on a global scale. No 
further material changes were made to the 2025 Exec-
utive Committee compensation system.

Compensation Committee membership changes
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to William 
Winters, who will step down from the Compensation 
Committee and the Board of Directors at the 2025 AGM, 
for his engagement and invaluable contributions through-
out his 12-year tenure. At the 2025 AGM, we will propose 
to shareholders the nomination of John Young as a new 
member of the Compensation Committee. To facilitate 
his onboarding, John attended the last four Compensa-
tion Committee meetings as a guest.
2025 Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
At the 2025 AGM, as in prior years, shareholders will be 
asked to vote on:
•	 The maximum aggregate amount of compensation for 
the Board of Directors from the 2025 AGM to the 2026 
AGM. Board fees will remain unchanged compared with 
the prior term, with the exception of the annual Board 
Chair fee, which will be CHF 3.5 million from the 2025 
AGM.
•	 The maximum aggregate amount of compensation for 
the Executive Committee for the financial year 2026, 
which remains the same as in the previous year. 
•	 This 2024 Compensation Report (advisory vote), which 
follows the same structure as in the previous year.
We trust that this Report and our 2025 Say-on-Pay bro-
chure provide you with the information required for you 
to vote in favor of the above. We continue to welcome 
your feedback, which is invaluable in driving improve-
ments in our Executive Committee and Board of Direc-
tors’ compensation systems and practices. 
Simon Moroney, D.Phil.
Chair of the Compensation Committee

CEO compensation and performance
2024 fixed pay and benefits
Annual base salary
The CEO 2024 base salary was: CHF 1 872 800 (2.4% salary increase effective as of March 1, 2024, in line with 
ordinary salary increases received by other Swiss employees).
Pension and other benefits
The CEO is a member of the Novartis Swiss pension funds, which provide company contributions on the base sal-
ary and an Annual Incentive up to the legal cap on the insured salary of CHF 882 000. No supplementary pension 
plans or savings plans are provided. The CEO’s employer pension contributions represent 9.2% of the base sal-
ary.
2024 CEO Annual Incentive balanced scorecard         
This section presents the balanced scorecard for the CEO. Financial performance is measured in constant curren-
cies (cc) to reflect operational performance that can be influenced. Performance outcomes for compensation pur-
poses may differ from reported numbers in accordance with our compensation adjustments policy. 
As communicated in the 2023 Compensation Report, in 2024, core operating income replaced operating income 
in the ECN financial measures. The Board reviewed the core adjustments made on operating income (as indicated 
in Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects − 5.A Operating results − Non-IFRS measures as defined 
by Novartis − Reconciliation from IFRS Accounting Standards results to non-IFRS measure core result) to arrive 
at the performance outcomes in the table above and decided not to make any discretionary adjustments to the pay 
outcomes.

2024 CEO Annual Incentive balanced scorecard (continued)
At the start of the performance cycle, the Board sets the CEO specific targets against each of the four strategic 
objectives listed below. We provide here a summary of those targets that most heavily impact overall performance 
and their respective achievement.
2024 was another strong performance exceeding external (consensus) and internal (targets) expectations. Sales, 
profit and free cash flow growth were strong. The focus on innovative medicines and simplification of our opera-
tions after the organizational restructuring are having a visible impact across the company. The Research and Devel-
opment units performed in line with our plan with targeted project timelines acceleration across R&D, and comple-
mentary BD&L/M&A deals were signed to bolster the company’s pipeline, although the Morphosys acquisition 
resulted in some unexpected challenges. In view of these achievements, the Board of Directors decided on an 
Annual Incentive payout for the CEO amounting to CHF 4 494 788, which is 160% of target, within the range of 
0‑200%.

•	 approval of Fabhalta IgAN in the US
•	 submission of atrasentan IgAN to the FDA
•	 submission of Pluvicto mCRPC, pre-taxane to the FDA
Additionally, we presented Kisqali NATALEE updated data in eBC and 
Renal portfolio data at ERA (Fabhalta, atrasentan, zigakibart)
Based on input from the Science & Technology Committee (STC), the 
Board of Directors approved a payout of 102% for this metric.

Our transformation into a pure-play innovative medicines company 
enabled a more focused allocation of resources and operational exe-
cution on priority brands. The following brands each exceeded their 
2022-2024 sales target (set at the beginning of the cycle) by over USD 
1 billion:
•	 Entresto: we strengthened our commercial focus and excellence 
across our targeted geographies.
•	 Pluvicto: product supply issues were promptly addressed as a higher 
eligible patient pool in the US drove increased sales.
•	 Kesimpta: streamlining our focus on neuroscience resulted in a larger 
share gain for the treatment of multiple sclerosis across several mar-
kets.
•	 Kisqali: following positive results from NATALEE and MONALEESA 
studies, we enhanced our investment and resource allocation in this 
brand.
COI CAGR outcome was equally successful reaching mid-teens growth 
as our strong sales performance was further strengthened by savings 
generated by our organizational transformation activities.
TSR for the 2022-2024 cycle was 53.6%. As a result, Novartis ranked 
No. 5 out of 15 healthcare companies (including Novartis), as our share 
price performance, growing dividend and spin-off of our generics busi-
ness, Sandoz, generated considerable value to shareholders. Applying 
the payout curve directly, this resulted in a payout of 130% under this 
metric.

2022-2024 LTPP cycle performance outcomes 
The charts below illustrate the very strong performance of the 2022-2024 LTPP cycle against target. The financial 
LTPP targets were recalibrated to take the Sandoz spin-off into account. Given that these metrics measure the 
compound annual growth rate, Sandoz targets were removed for the financial years 2023 and 2024. For the rela-
tive TSR measure, the dividend in kind distribution was treated as a one-time dividend that is not reinvested.

CEO and Executive Committee
CEO and Executive Committee 2024 realized compensation
To aid shareholders’ understanding of the link between pay and performance, the Compensation Report discloses 
the realized compensation for the CEO on an individual basis, and for the other ECN members on an aggregated 
basis. Disclosing realized compensation means that the Annual Incentive and the LTPP are disclosed at the end of 
their respective performance cycles, reflecting actual payouts based on performance.
The total actual payout may vary year on year depending on multiple factors, including the composition of the 
Executive Committee and the tenure of its members (as new members may not have equity vestings), compensa-
tion increases, payout of variable compensation based on actual performance, share price fluctuations, and divi-
dend equivalents.
The table below shows compensation for all ECN members for the financial year 2024, including base salary, 
pension, other benefits, 2024 Annual Incentive, 2022-2024 LTPP cycle payout, and any buyouts paid or vesting 
within the year. The table also includes the total 2023 realized compensation for all Executive Committee mem-
bers for comparison.
To determine the appropriateness of 2024 CEO and executive compensation payouts under the Annual Incen-
tive and LTPP, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee reviewed management’s performance 
against targets set at the beginning of the cycles as described in “—2024 CEO Annual Incentive balanced score-
card” and “—2022-2024 LTPP cycle performance outcomes.” 
The incentive performance outcomes, combined with base salary and other benefits, pension, keep-whole awards 
(awards granted in connection with the Sandoz spin-off) and dividend equivalents, resulted in 2024 total realized 
compensation for the CEO of CHF 19 165 899, an increase of 18% compared with 2023 (CHF 16 248 178). This 
increase was largely driven by the higher performance payout of the 2022-2024 LTPP cycle (158% compared with 
122% payout for the 2021-2023 LTPP cycle).

1	All compensation amounts are stated gross, before the deduction of social security contributions and income tax paid by the Executive Committee members. Amounts for Executive 
Committee members paid in USD were converted at a rate of USD 1.00 = CHF 0.8805, which is the same average exchange rate used in the Company’s 2024 consolidated financial 
statements (a similar rule applies to payments made in other currencies during the year).
	
2	Aggregate realized compensation of the other 10 Executive Committee members.
	
3	Aggregate realized compensation of the other 11 Executive Committee members, including a member who stepped down during the financial year 2023. For more information, see 
item 6B of the 2023 Annual Report.
	
4	The portion of the Annual Incentive delivered in equity is rounded up to the nearest share, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 24, 2025) of CHF 90.26 per 
Novartis share and USD 99.97 per ADR. At the start of the 2024 performance period, Vasant Narasimhan, Aharon Gal, Harry Kirsch, Steffen Lang and Klaus Moosmayer had met their 
shareholding requirement and therefore received at least 30% of their Annual Incentive in equity. All other Executive Committee members who had not yet met their shareholding 
requirement at the start of the 2024 performance period, received at least 50% of their Annual Incentive in equity.
	
5	The portion of the Annual Incentive delivered in equity is rounded up to the nearest share, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 24, 2024) of CHF 93.53 per 
Novartis share and USD 107.55 per ADR.
	
6	The amount represents the underlying share value of the 397 777 realized LTPP PSUs to the CEO and other Executive Committee members for the 2022-2024 LTPP cycle, including 
dividend equivalents for the three-year cycle of value CHF 1 128 701 for the CEO and CHF 2 017 311 for the other Executive Committee members. The taxable value is determined 
using the closing share price, on the day the payout factor is approved by the Board of Directors (January 24, 2025), of CHF 90.26 per Novartis share and USD 99.97 per ADR. 
Includes vested keep-whole shares received in connection with the Sandoz spin-off. During the course of the 2022 performance period, Victor Bulto was promoted to the Executive 
Committee and Shreeram Aradhye rejoined Novartis. As such, the information disclosed reflects their pro-rata 2022-2024 LTPP payout attributable to the period in which they were 
members of the Executive Committee. Aharon Gal, Fiona Marshall and Patrick Horber joined Novartis after the 2022-2024 LTPP awards were made, and therefore did not receive an 
LTPP award for the 2022-2024 LTPP cycle.
	
7	Based on the closing share price of January 24, 2024 of CHF 93.53 per Novartis share and USD 107.55 per ADR for all members.
	
8	Includes any other perquisites, benefits in-kind, and international assignment benefits as per the global mobility policy (e.g., housing, international health insurance, children’s school 
fees, tax equalization). The compensation and benefits elements related to the period after the step-down dates are also reported under ‘other payments’.
	
9	In line with the buyout policy of Novartis (see “—CEO and Executive Committee: appointments”), includes 8 607 vested ADRs (for a total value of USD 834 580), which vested partially 
on March 31, 2024, and partially on May 1, 2024, to Fiona Marshall to replace compensation that she forfeited when leaving her previous employer.  Includes also 3 116 vested RSUs 
and 39 976 PSUs (for a total value of CHF 3 955 219), which vested partially on January 20, 2024, on February 1, 2024 and on January 26, 2025 as well as CHF 1 058 274 paid in cash 
in March 2024, to Patrick Horber to replace compensation that he forfeited when leaving his previous employer. Includes also 3 050 vested RSUs (for a total value of CHF 279 472), 
which vested on February 26, 2024, to Shreeram Aradhye to replace compensation that he forfeited when leaving his previous employer.
	 10	Includes social security contributions to the extent that they result in a pension entitlement. Includes also contributions to company provided pension plans.
	 11	This amount is out of total social security employer contributions of CHF 3 279 227 and pension employer contributions of CHF 2 158 144 paid in 2024 for all Executive Committee 
members.
	 12	This amount is out of total social security employer contributions of CHF 1 933 476 and pension employer contributions of CHF 1 852 898 paid in 2023 for all Executive Committee 
members.
	 13	Includes CHF 5 975 824 for the member who stepped down during 2023.

Pay for performance assessment
To assess whether the target-setting process provided for sufficiently stringent targets in the 2022-2024 LTPP 
cycle, the Compensation Committee reviewed the past five LTPP payouts. It found a strong correlation between 
the LTPP payout and the three-year total shareholder return, as shown in the table below, demonstrating alignment 
with shareholders’ experience. The Committee also recognized the high variability of payouts across the years.

1	 For this cycle, two LTI plans existed (with different metrics): LTPP (75% NCVA, 25% Innovation) and LTRPP (100% rTSR), which merged into one plan from 2021. Payout represents 
the average CEO weighted payout.
2	The starting share price and ending share price for the TSR measure are calculated as the average of the closing share prices over the 3 months prior to December 31, with the 
closing prices of all trading days equally weighted to derive the average.
The Board of Directors reviewed the overall 2024 incentive outcomes against the performance of the company, 
acknowledging the period of uncertainty at the time the targets were set, and decided that pay and performance 
are well aligned. As with prior years, it decided that no adjustments were required and did not apply any discretion 
to the 2022-2024 LTPP payout.

CEO and Executive Committee 2024 compensation at grant
In accordance with the Swiss Code of Obligations, Novartis discloses total compensation at grant value for the CEO 
and Executive Committee. 
The table below provides the following compensation information for the CEO, the CFO and the Presidents of our 
International and US organizations individually, while for all other ECN target pay is aggregated:
•	 2024 base salary
•	 Actual cash portion and portion deferred in equity of the 2024 Annual Incentive
•	 2024-2026 LTPP cycle awards, which are reported at target grant date value, based on the assumption that the 
awards will vest at 100% achievement, excluding any share price movement and dividend equivalents that may be 
accrued over the performance cycle. The future payout will be determined only after the performance cycle con-
cludes in three years (i.e., at the end of 2026), with a performance factor of 0% to 200% of the target value
•	 Other payments for 2024, which include other benefits, either paid in cash or granted in equity during the year
•	 2024 pension benefits
•	 Total 2024 and total 2023 compensation at grant, for comparative purposes
The highest-paid individual in 2024 was Vasant Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis.
The CEO 2024 compensation at grant increased compared with 2023 mainly due to the CEO LTPP target increase 
from 325% to 400%, effective 2024-2026 LTPP cycle, as communicated in the 2023 Compensation Report, which 
received strong support from shareholders. The compensation at grant for all Executive Committee members is 
lower compared with 2023 (CHF 62 887 204 versus CHF 68 365 598) mainly due to a reduction in the number of 
members reported (in 2023, one member stepped down, compared with none in 2024).

Other payments to Executive Committee 
members (audited)
During 2024 (like 2023), no other payments or waivers 
of claims other than those set out in the tables (includ-
ing the footnotes) contained in this Compensation Report 
were made to Executive Committee members or to “per-
sons closely linked” to them.
Executive Committee compensation approved 
by shareholders (audited)
The total compensation dispensed by the Company in 
2024 is within the Say-on-Pay budget approved by the 
shareholders at the 2023 AGM (CHF 90 000 000).
Payments to former Executive Committee 
members (audited)
Under the employment contracts of Executive Committee 
members and in line with the Company’s LTI plan rules, 
payments were made to 8 former members. Of these pay-
ments, CHF 8 281 897 (CHF 8 725 507 in 2023) relate to 
the vesting of LTI awards. In addition, contractual amounts 
totaling CHF 1 913 169 (CHF 5 028 812 in 2023). In 2024, 
there were no payments made in relation to tax equal-
ization on variable compensation granted during inter-
national 
assignments/commuter 
arrangements 
(CHF 221 718 in 2023). In 2024, the highest paid former 
Executive Committee member was Marie-France 
Tschudin who received CHF 6 195 281 (comprising the 
base salary, the Annual Incentive, realized LTI and other 
benefits). In 2023, John Tsai was the highest paid former 
Executive Committee member, receiving CHF 3 537 225. 
No other payments (or waivers of claims) were made to 
former Executive Committee members or to “persons 
closely linked” to them during 2024 (like 2023).
Persons closely linked
“Persons closely linked”, a definition used throughout the 
Annual Report, are (i) their spouse or equivalent, (ii) their 
children (under 18 years of age), (iii) any legal entities that 
they own or otherwise control, and (iv) any legal or natu-
ral person who is acting as their fiduciary.
Malus and clawback
Consistent with our “—CEO and Executive Committee 
compensation philosophy and system,” in 2024 there was 
no legal or factual basis on which to exercise malus or 
clawback for current or former Executive Committee 
members. 
Award and delivery of equity to Novartis 
employees (audited) 
During 2024, 10.0 million restricted shares (or ADRs), 
RSUs and target PSUs were granted, and 9.6 million 
Novartis vested shares (or ADRs) were delivered to 
Novartis employees under various equity-based participa-
tion plans. Current unvested equity instruments held by 
employees represent 0.93% of issued shares (based on 
a total of 1.8 million restricted shares, 15.5 million RSUs 
and 3.1 million target PSUs). Novartis delivers treasury 
shares to employees to fulfill these obligations and aims 
to offset the dilutive impact from its equity-based partici-
pation plans.
Note 26 to the Company’s audited consolidated 
financial statements (audited)
The total expense for the year for compensation awarded 
to Executive Committee, using IFRS Accounting Stan-
dards measurement rules, is presented in Note 26 to the

CEO and Executive Committee 
compensation philosophy and system
Compensation philosophy
Our compensation philosophy aims to ensure that we 
attract and retain outstanding Executive Committee 
members and reward them according to their success 
in implementing the Company strategy, as well as their 
contribution to Company performance and long-term 
value creation.  The main elements of our compensation 
philosophy are set out in the table below.
Approach to market benchmarking
Significant competition continues to exist for top execu-
tive talent with deep expertise and the requisite compe-
tencies and proven performance within the pharmaceu-
tical and biotechnology industries. For this reason, 
external peer compensation data is one of a number of 
key reference points considered by the Board of Direc-
tors and the Compensation Committee when making 
decisions on executive pay, to help ensure that the com-
pensation system and levels at Novartis remain competi-
tive. Novartis is committed to transparency in its bench-
marking practices, including the disclosure of its healthcare 
peer group to shareholders on an annual basis. 
The Compensation Committee believes in a rigorous 
approach to peer group construction and maintenance. 
Furthermore, it believes that using a consistent set of 
global peers that is similar to Novartis in size and scope 
of operations enables shareholders to evaluate compen-
sation year on year and make pay-for-performance com-
parisons. 
Although Novartis is headquartered in Switzerland, 
more than a third of its sales come from the US market, 
and the US therefore represents a significant talent pool 
for the recruitment of executives by the Company. The 
Compensation Committee uses a pay comparator group 
of global healthcare companies to ensure that Novartis 
is able to attract and retain key talent globally. To ensure 
European and local practices are fully taken into account, 
the Compensation Committee also uses a cross-indus-
try peer group of Europe-headquartered multinational 
companies of a similar size and scope. Following an 
extensive review in 2024, both peer groups remain 
unchanged compared with 2023.

PLAN OVERVIEW
Target Annual Incentive 
On-target opportunities
•	 CEO: 150% of annual base salary.
•	 Other Executive Committee members: 80% to 120% of annual base salary.
Performance measures
•	 An Annual Incentive balanced scorecard containing:
•	 Financial performance measures (60% weighting) related to the Company 
•	 Strategic objectives (40% weighting)
•	 The balanced scorecard targets and achievements of the CEO are detailed in “—2024 CEO Annual 
Incentive balanced scorecard.”
•	 The balanced scorecards for individual Executive Committee members include the same company financial 
targets (60% weighting) as well as individual qualitative and quantitative targets (40% weighting).
•	 Values and Behaviors are a key component of the Annual Incentive and are embedded in our culture. As 
such, members of the Executive Committee are expected to demonstrate these to the highest standards.
Target setting
•	 Financial targets are set at the beginning of each financial year and align with the strategic plan proposed 
by management to the Board of Directors for approval.
•	 The strategic objectives are aligned with the most important priorities in any performance year.
Payout ranges
•	 The payout schedule for the Annual Incentive incorporates performance against financial and strategic 
objectives. The payout range is 0% to 200% of on-target opportunity based on performance, as shown 
below:
PERFORMANCE	
PAYOUT (% of on-target)
Outstanding	
170% – 200%
Exceeds expectations	
130% – 160%
Meets expectations	
80% – 120%
Partially meets expectations	
40% – 70%
Below expectations	
0%
  
Payout formula
Payout vehicle
•	 At the end of the performance period, 50% is paid in cash, and the remaining 50% is delivered in Novartis 
equity (restricted shares or RSUs) deferred for three years. If the shareholding requirement is met, the 
portion of the Annual Incentive that is mandatorily deferred in equity is reduced to 30%.
•	 Executives may choose to receive all or part of the cash portion of their Annual Incentive in Novartis shares 
or American Depositary Receipts (ADRs; US only) that will not be subject to forfeiture conditions. In the US, 
awards may also be delivered in cash under the US deferred compensation plan.
Dividend rights, voting rights  
and settlement
•	 Novartis restricted shares and ADRs carry voting rights and dividends during the vesting period. 
•	 RSUs are of equivalent value but do not carry voting rights and dividends during the vesting period. 
Following the vesting period, settlement of RSUs is made in unrestricted Novartis shares or ADRs.

 Components of CEO and Executive Committee compensation 
The compensation of the CEO and Executive Committee is comprised of fixed pay, including an annual base salary, 
pension and other benefits, in addition to a variable annual incentive and long-term incentive, which are entirely per-
formance based.
Fixed pay and benefits
Annual base salary
•	 The annual base salary is based on the individual’s role, skills and experience. It is reviewed on an annual basis 
based on an external benchmark for the role, the performance of the individual, business performance and 
the external environment, salary increases across the Company and market movements.
Pension and other benefits
•	 Pension and other benefits are provided to the Executive Committee members on the same terms as to all 
other employees based on local country practices and regulations. No supplementary pension plans or sav-
ings plans are provided. 
•	 Pension and other benefits do not constitute a significant proportion of total compensation. 
•	 Globally the Company operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans (see also Note 
24 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements). 
•	 Novartis may provide other benefits according to local market practice. These include the provision of a com-
pany car, tax and financial planning, and insurance benefits.

PLAN OVERVIEW
Award vehicle
Performance share units (PSUs) are granted at the beginning of the three-year performance cycle and vest 
at the end of the cycle to the extent that performance conditions have been met. At the time of vesting, they 
are converted into Novartis shares.
PSUs carry dividend equivalents that are paid in shares at the end of the cycle.
Grant formula 
At the start of the performance cycle, PSUs are granted under the LTPP, as follows:
Target opportunity 
•	 CEO: 325% of annual base salary
•	 Other Executive Committee members: between 180% and 260% of annual base salary
Performance measures	
•	 Third-party sales CAGR (25%)
•	 Core operating income CAGR (25%)
•	 Innovation (25%)
•	 Relative TSR (25%)
Target setting
Financial targets: Targets for third-party sales CAGR and core operating income CAGR are set based on 
the three-year strategic plan of the Company. 
Innovation: Development targets are based on targeted filings communicated at the start of each three-
year performance cycle, weighted 70%. For cycle 2022-2024, Biomedical Research targets consider the 
expected Net Present Value (eNPV) of programs transitioning to late-stage clinical development. Effective 
2024-2026 LTPP cycle, given the earlier involvement from our commercial and strategy and growth business 
areas, all projects transitioning to late-stage clinical development have strategic value and are therefore 
scored equally.
Payout range
Financial targets: When assessing performance, achievements for threshold, target and maximum payout are 
defined for each metric, and a payout curve is applied to determine the corresponding payout between 0‑200% 
against target.
Innovation: At the end of the cycle, the Compensation Committee determines, following input from the STC, 
the payout factor based on the number of relevant clinical milestones achieved against the target score.
Relative TSR: Performance on TSR is assessed relative to our global healthcare peer group, as outlined 
below. A three-month averaging method is used for both the start and the end of the performance cycle. 
Companies are then ranked in order of highest to lowest TSR in USD.  No payout for below median TSR 
applies.
The Board of Directors may use its discretion on each metric, including deciding on the payout within the 
ranges where appropriate. In doing so, it takes into consideration factors such as the underlying assumptions 
of the targets set at the beginning of the cycle, overall economic conditions, currency fluctuations and other 
unforeseeable situations.

ELEMENT OF COMPENSATION	
POLICY
Level
The overall package should be market-competitive to enable the recruitment of global executive talent with 
deep expertise and competencies.
The Compensation Committee may appoint individuals who are new to a role on an annual base salary 
(and/or incentives) that is below the market level, with a view to increase this toward market level over a 
period of three to four years as an individual develops in the role.
If the scope of an existing Executive Committee member’s role changes significantly during the year, the 
Compensation Committee may make adjustments to the individual’s base salary (and/or incentives) in 
consideration of the benchmark of the new role and the Executive Committee appointments compensation 
policy.
Annual base salary
This prudent approach ensures pay levels are merit-based, with increases dependent on strong 
performance and proven ability in the role over a sustained period.
Incentives
The compensation package will normally include the key compensation elements and incentive 
opportunities in line with those offered to current Executive Committee members.
In exceptional circumstances, higher incentive opportunities than those offered to current Executive 
Committee members may be provided at the Compensation Committee’s discretion.
Performance measures may include business-specific measures tailored to the specific role.
Pension and other benefits
Newly appointed Executive Committee members are eligible for the local country pension plan and other 
benefits in line with the wider employee group.
Buyouts
The Compensation Committee seeks to balance the need to offer competitive compensation opportunities 
to acquire the talent required by the business with the principle of maintaining a strong focus on pay for 
performance.
As such, when an individual forfeits variable compensation as a result of an appointment at Novartis, 
the Compensation Committee may offer replacement awards to compensate the commercial equivalent 
value or fair value of payments and awards forfeited by the individual, in such form as the Compensation 
Committee considers appropriate, taking into account relevant factors.
Relevant factors include the expected value of the forfeited award, the replacement vehicle (i.e., cash, 
restricted share units, restricted shares or performance share units), whether the award is contingent on 
meeting performance conditions or not, the timing of forfeiture (i.e., Novartis mirrors the blocking or vesting 
period of the forfeited award) and the leaver conditions, in case the recruited individual leaves Novartis 
prior to the end of the blocking or vesting period.
International mobility 
If individuals are required to relocate or be assigned away from their home location to take up their position, 
relocation support may be provided in line with our global mobility policies (e.g., relocation support, tax 
equalization). This includes ongoing US state income tax liabilities on behalf of US citizens locally employed 
outside the US who have US workdays and therefore, US state taxable compensation that generates a US 
state tax liability.

CEO and Executive Committee share ownership requirements 
CEO and Executive Committee members are required to own a minimum multiple of their annual base salary in 
Novartis equity as set out in the table below. The Compensation Committee reviews compliance with the share 
ownership guideline on an annual basis.

CEO and Executive Committee: termination arrangements 
Further details are provided in in our “—Risk Management principles.”
Malus and clawback policy
Any incentive compensation paid to Executive Commit-
tee members is subject to malus and clawback rules. 
This means that the Board of Directors for the CEO, and 
the Compensation Committee for the other Executive 
Committee members, may decide – subject to applica-
ble law – to retain any unpaid or unvested incentive com-
pensation (malus), or to recover incentive compensation 
that has been paid or vested in the past (clawback). This 
applies in cases where the payout has resulted from a 
violation of laws or conflicts with internal management 
standards, including Company and accounting policies, 
as well as with US Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) Rule requirements. 
This principle applies to both the short-term Annual 
Incentive and all long-term incentive plans.


### Page 90 ###

Objective setting
•	The CEO proposes his targets to the 
Board Chair; they are then reviewed and 
approved by the Board of Directors.
•	For other Executive Committee 
members, targets for their business 
units or functions are initially discussed 
with the CEO and subsequently 
approved by the Board of Directors.
Performance evaluation
•	The CEO’s performance against 
the individual balanced scorecard is 
assessed by the Board of Directors.
•	For Executive Committee members, 
the CEO discusses each member’s 
performance (assessed against 
their individual balanced scorecard) 
with the Board Chair before making 
recommendations to the Board of 
Directors for final determination.
•	Periodic assessments, including at the 
mid-year stage, ensure progress is 
suitably tracked.
Compensation determination 
•	A recommendation for the CEO’s 
variable pay is made by the 
Compensation Committee to the Board 
of Directors for final determination.
•	For the LTPP financial measures’ 
payout schedules, a formulaic approach 
applies, and the Compensation 
Committee can also exercise judgment 
to ensure there is appropriate 
alignment between payout levels and 
overall performance achieved. The 
same principle of discretion applies 
to the relative TSR and innovation 
performance measures.
•	The CEO’s recommendations for 
other Executive Committee members 
are considered and approved by the 
Compensation Committee, after which 
the Board of Directors is notified of the 
outcomes.

CEO and Executive Committee performance management 
To foster a high-performance culture, the Company applies a performance management process based on quan-
titative and qualitative criteria. The CEO and the other Executive Committee members are subject to a formal three-
step process, which consists of objective setting, performance evaluation and compensation determination. This 
process is explained in the chart below.
Performance targets are generally set before the start of the relevant performance cycle. A rigorous framework 
is in place for establishing targets to ensure they are suitably robust, challenging and aligned with the strategic pri-
orities of the Company.
The key factors taken into account when setting targets include:
•	 Internal and external market expectations 
•	 The strategic priorities of Novartis
•	 Regulatory factors (e.g., new launches, patent expiries)
•	 Investment in capital expenditure
•	 Novartis Values and Behaviors
The targets are challenged at multiple stages before they are ultimately approved by the Board of Directors. In line 
with good governance practices, the Compensation Committee works to set targets that are ambitious and chal-
lenging but do not encourage undue risk-taking. 
Following the end of the performance cycle, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee consider 
performance against the targets originally set. The CEO and Executive Committee members are not present while 
the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee discuss their individual performance evaluations and 
determine their individual compensation. Prior to determining the final outcome, related factors such as perfor-
mance relative to peers, wider market conditions, general industry trends and best practice are used to inform the 
overall performance assessment.

Executive Committee 2025 compensation 
Each year, we collaborate with our independent external advisors to benchmark the compensation levels of the 
Executive Committee members and assess the competitiveness of their total target compensation. 2025 compen-
sation increases have been made after taking into account demonstrated performance and ability in role as out-
lined in “—CEO and Executive Committee: appointments.” In accordance with our policy to increase total target 
compensation towards a more market competitive level over a period of three to four years as an individual devel-
ops in the role, we have made the following changes effective 2025: 
Victor Bulto, President, US
Mr. Bulto, appointed in April 2022, delivered strong results with significant overperformance across key brands and 
launches for Cosentyx HS, Fabhalta, Scemblix, and Kisqali. Mr. Bulto will receive a 3.5% increase in annual base sal-
ary and a 30 ppts increase in LTPP target, as a percentage of annual base salary.
Patrick Horber, President, International
Mr. Horber, appointed in December 2023, demonstrated notable successes across key International geographies, 
delivering nearly USD 1 billion sales above target. Mr. Horber will receive a 3.5% increase in annual base salary and 
a 30 ppts increase in LTPP target, as a percentage of annual base salary.
Following a strong performance, a further four Executive Committee members, who assumed their role in the last 
four years, will receive an increase in annual base salary between 1.6-6.0%, and/or a 10 ppts increase in their Annual 
Incentive and/or LTPP target, as a percentage of annual base salary.
All other Executive Committee members, including the CEO, will receive ordinary base salary increases received 
by other employees in their country of employment (1.6% for Switzerland and 3.5% for US), effective March 1, 2025. 
Their Annual Incentive and LTPP targets remain unchanged.
Pay practice for other employees
The Board of Directors is committed to ensuring fair and competitive compensation practices across the entire 
organization. Recent such examples include an approved global budget of over USD 384 million for salary adjust-
ments during 2025, maintaining our existing Equal Pay International Coalition (EPIC) and Living Wage commitments 
globally, starting a new global program to implement our renewed EPIC commitments in view of the EU Directive 
and expanding our all-employee share purchase plan which is now available to employees in over 50 countries 
globally. More details can be found in the Novartis in Society Integrated Report 2024.

Board compensation philosophy and fee 
structure
Philosophy and benchmarking
Aligned with market practice in Switzerland, the Board 
of Directors sets compensation for its members at a level 
that allows for the attraction of high-caliber individuals, 
including both Swiss and international members, who 
have global experience.
Given their focus on corporate strategy, supervision 
and governance, Board members do not receive variable 
compensation. Each year at the AGM, shareholders are 
requested to approve, in a binding vote, the total com-
pensation of the Board of Directors until the following 
AGM.
The Board of Directors sets the level of compensa-
tion for its Chair and other members to be in line with 
relevant benchmark companies, including other large 
Switzerland-based multinational companies such as 
ABB, Holcim, Nestlé, Richemont, Roche, Swiss Re, UBS 
and Zurich Insurance. This peer group, which remains 
the same as last year, was chosen due to the compara-
bility of Swiss legal requirements, including broad per-
sonal and individual liabilities under Swiss law (and crim-
inal liability under Swiss rules regarding board and 
executive committee compensation related to the Swiss 
Code of Obligations), and under US law, where applica-
ble (due to the Company’s secondary listing on the New 
York Stock Exchange). To ensure independent deci-
sion-making, the peer group used for the Board of Direc-
tors is different to that used for the Executive Commit-
tee. Each year, the Board of Directors reviews the 
compensation of its members, including the Board Chair, 
based on a proposal by the Compensation Committee 
and advice from its independent advisor, including rele-
vant benchmarking information. 
The Board Chair’s contract and the Board of Direc-
tors compensation policy do not provide for any termi-
nation-related payments.
Share ownership requirements for 
Board members 
To ensure their interests are aligned with those of share-
holders the Board Chair is required to own a minimum 
of 30 000 Novartis shares, and other members of the 
Board of Directors are required to own at least 5 000 
Novartis shares, within five years of having joined the 
Board of Directors.
Board members are prohibited from hedging or 
pledging their ownership positions in Novartis shares 
that are part of their guideline share ownership require-
ment and are required to maintain this requirement for 
12 months after having retired from the Board of Direc-
tors. As at December 31, 2024, all current and former 
members of the Board of Directors who were required 
to meet the minimum share ownership requirements did 
so. 
Board fee structure
The AGM 2024-2025 annual fee rates for Board member-
ship and additional functions are included in the table 
below. These were approved by the Board of Directors 
and remain unchanged from the prior term. Aggregate 
Board compensation is aligned with other large Swiss 
companies.
Board members receive only fixed compensation and 
do not receive additional fees for attending meetings. 
Fees paid are at least 50% in Novartis shares (up to 100% 
at the choice of each Board member) and the remainder 
is paid in cash. Board members bear the full cost of their 
employee social security contributions, if any.
For 2024, the Board Chair voluntarily waived the 
increase in compensation to which he is contractually 
entitled.

Board members do not receive any company pension, 
insurance or other benefits, unless mandated by local 
legislation. Novartis will pay mandatory employer contri-
butions for the incoming Board Chair as required by law, 
should his nomination be approved at the 2025 AGM.
AGM 2025-2026 changes
The Board of Directors approved an annual Board Chair 
compensation of CHF 3.5 million effective from the 2025 
AGM, which is in line with our peer group median. No fur-
ther changes will be made to the Board fees from the 
2025 AGM to the 2026 AGM.

Compensation governance 
Legal framework
The Swiss Code of Obligations and the corporate gov-
ernance guidelines of the SIX Swiss Exchange require 
listed companies to disclose certain information about 
the compensation of board and executive committee 
members, their equity participation, and loans made to 
them. This Annual Report fulfills that requirement in addi-
tion to being in line with the principles of the Swiss Code 
of Best Practice for Corporate Governance of the Swiss 
Business Federation (economiesuisse). For more infor-
mation, see “—Corporate Governance” in Section 6C of 
this Annual Report.
Compensation decision-making 
authorities
Authority for decisions related to compensation is gov-
erned by the Articles of Incorporation, Board Regulations 
and the Compensation Committee Charter, which are all 
published on the Company website: www.novartis.com/
investors/company-overview/corporate-governance. 
The Compensation Committee serves as the supervi-
sory and governing body for compensation policies and 
plans within Novartis, and has overall responsibility for 
determining, reviewing and proposing compensation pol-
icies and plans for approval by the Board of Directors in 
line with the Compensation Committee Charter. The dis-
cussions and conclusions of each committee meeting 
are delivered to the full Board of Directors. A summary 
of the compensation decision-making authorities is set 
out below.

Committee member independence
The Compensation Committee is composed exclusively 
of members of the Board of Directors who meet the inde-
pendence criteria set forth in the Board Regulations. From 
the 2024 AGM, the Compensation Committee consisted 
of the following four members: Simon Moroney (as Chair), 
Patrice Bula, Bridgette Heller, and William Winters. Wil-
liam Winters will step down from the Board and Com-
pensation Committee at the 2025 AGM. John Young will 
be proposed for nomination to the Compensation Com-
mittee at the 2025 AGM. 
Role of the Compensation 
Committee’s independent advisor
The independent external compensation advisor sup-
ports the Compensation Committee in determining the 
design and implementation of compensation and bene-
fits. 
In 2024, the Compensation Committee retained Mitul 
Shah of Deloitte LLP, who was appointed in July 2022, 
as its independent compensation advisor. The indepen-
dent advisor from Deloitte LLP and his respective team 
that advised and supported the Compensation Commit-
tee are not responsible or rewarded for work on senior 
compensation beyond support provided to the Compen-
sation Committee and the People & Organization func-
tion.
Meetings held in 2024 and self-
evaluation
In 2024, the Compensation Committee held six formal 
meetings. For the approval of the Board of Directors, in 
line with prior years, it collaborated with the Science & 
Technology Committee to review and endorse the inno-
vation targets and achievements of the 2024 Annual 
Incentive and the 2022-2024 LTPP. The Compensation 
Committee conducted a self-evaluation in 2024.
Risk management principles
The Compensation Committee, with support from its 
independent compensation advisor, reviews market 
trends in compensation, and changes in corporate gov-
ernance rules and best practices. Together with the Risk 
Committee, it also reviews the Novartis compensation 
systems to ensure that they do not encourage inappro-
priate or excessive risk-taking, and instead encourage 
behaviors that support sustainable value creation. A 
summary of the risk management principles is outlined 
below.
RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES
•	 Rigorous performance 
management process, with 
approval of targets and 
­evaluation of performance 
of the CEO by the Board of 
Directors
•	 Balanced mix of short-term and 
long-term variable compensa-
tion elements
•	 Novartis Values and Behav-
iors are a key component of 
the Annual Incentive and are 
embedded in our culture
•	 Clawback and malus principles 
apply to all elements of the 
variable compensation
•	 Performance-vesting Long-
Term Incentives only, with 
three-year cycles 
•	 All variable compensation is 
capped at 200% of target
•	 Contractual notice period of 
12 months
•	 Post-contractual non-compete 
period is limited to a maximum 
of 12 months from the end 
of employment. Resulting 
compensation, if applicable, will 
not exceed the average annual 
compensation (annual base 
salary plus Annual Incentive) 
of the previous three financial 
years
•	 Good and bad leaver provisions 
apply to variable ­compensation 
of leavers
•	 No severance payments or 
change-of-control clauses
•	 Share ownership requirements; 
no hedging or pledging of 
Novartis share ownership
•	 No loans granted to current 
or former members of the 
Executive Committee and 
the Board of Directors or to 
“Persons closely linked” to 
them (audited)

Report of the statutory auditor
﻿

Report of the statutory auditor
To the General Meeting of Novartis AG, Basel 
Report on the Audit of the Compensation Report
Opinion
We have audited the Compensation Report of Novartis 
AG (the Company) for the year ended December 31, 
2024. The audit was limited to the information pursuant 
to Art. 734a-734f of the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO) 
in the tables marked “audited” on page 75, pages 77 to 
80, pages 88 to 89, and pages 92 to 93 of the Compen-
sation Report.
In our opinion, the information pursuant to Art. 
734a-734f CO in the accompanying Compensation 
Report complies with Swiss law and the Company’s arti-
cles of incorporation.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law 
and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our respon-
sibilities under those provisions and standards are fur-
ther described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Compensation Report” section of our report. 
We are independent of the Company in accordance with 
the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the 
Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these require-
ments.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion.
Other Information
The Board of Directors is responsible for the other infor-
mation. The other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report, but does not include the 
tables marked “audited” in the Compensation Report, 
the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone 
financial statements and our auditor’s reports thereon.
Our opinion on the Compensation Report does not 
cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Compensation 
Report, our responsibility is to read the other informa-
tion and, in doing so, consider whether the other infor-
mation is materially inconsistent with the audited finan-
cial information in the Compensation Report or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we con-
clude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard.
Board of Directors’ Responsibilities 
for the Compensation Report
The Board of Directors is responsible for the prepara-
tion of a Compensation Report in accordance with the 
provisions of Swiss law and the Company’s articles of 
incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board 
of Directors determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of a Compensation Report that is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The 
Board of Directors is also responsible for designing the 
Compensation system and defining individual Compen-
sation packages.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Compensation Report
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the information pursuant to Art. 734a-734f CO 
is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assur-
ance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered mate-
rial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reason-
ably be expected to influence the economic decisions 
of users taken on the basis of this Compensation Report.

Report of the statutory auditor
﻿
95
As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and 
SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
in the Compensation Report, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures respon-
sive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstate-
ment resulting from fraud is higher than for one result-
ing from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.
•	
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effective-
ness of the Company’s internal control.
•	
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting esti-
mates and related disclosures made.
We communicate with the Board of Directors or its rel-
evant committee regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant 
committee with a statement that we have complied with 
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, 
and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, actions taken to 
eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

support sustainable financial performance and long-
term value creation for our shareholders, patients, 
employees and other stakeholders based on our Values 
and Behaviors.
Novartis AG is subject to and compliant with the laws 
and regulations of Switzerland (in particular Swiss com-
pany and securities law, SIX Swiss Exchange rules and 
the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Gover-
nance) and the securities laws of the United States,

The Governance, Sustainability and Nomination Com-

ernance principles and the key governance documents 
against evolving best practice standards and new devel-
opments in line with our commitment to maintaining the 
highest standards.

 Duty to make an offer
According to the Swiss Federal Act on Financial Infra-
structures, anyone who – directly, indirectly or acting 
in concert with third parties – acquires equity securi-
ties exceeding 33.3% of the voting rights of a company 
(whether or not such rights are exercisable) is required 
to make an offer to acquire all listed equity securities of 
that company. A company may raise this threshold up to 
49% of the voting rights (“opting up”) or may, under cer-
tain circumstances, waive the threshold (“opting out”). 
Novartis AG has not adopted any such measures.
Cross shareholdings
Novartis AG has no cross shareholdings in excess of 
5% of capital, or voting rights with any other company.
Overview on shareholder structure
The following tables relate only to registered share-
holders and cannot be assumed to represent the entire 
 investor base because nominees and  JPMorgan Chase 
Bank, N.A., as ADS depositary, are registered as share-
holders for a large number of beneficial owners.
As of December 31, 2024, Novartis AG had approxi-
mately 186 000 registered shareholders.

 Capital structure
Share capital
As of December 31, 2024, the share capital amounted 
to CHF 1 073 065 943.53 fully paid-in and divided into 
2 189 930 497 registered shares with a nominal value 
of CHF 0.49 each. 
Shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (ISIN 
CH0012005267, symbol: NOVN) and on the New York 
Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of ­American Depos-
itary Receipts (ADRs) representing American Deposi-
tary Shares (ADSs) (ISIN US66987V1098, symbol: NVS).
No conditional capital exists as of December 31, 2024 
nor has a capital band been introduced in the Compa-
ny’s Articles of Incorporation.
Shares, participation certificates, 
non-voting equity securities, profit-
sharing certificates
Shares are issued as uncertificated securities (in the 
sense of the Swiss Code of Obligations) and as book 
entry securities (in terms of the Swiss Act on Intermedi-
ated Securities). All shares have equal voting rights and 
carry equal entitlements to dividends. No participation 
certificates, non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine) 
or profit-sharing  certificates have been issued.
 
Convertible securities and options
Novartis AG has not issued convertible or exchangeable 
bonds, warrants, options or other securities granting 
rights to shares, other than certain instruments granted 
under or in connection with equity-based participation 
plans of employees.
Limitation on transferability 
No transferability restrictions are imposed on shares (for 
registration restrictions, see “—Item 6.C Board practices—
Shareholder participation—Voting rights, restrictions and 
representation—Registration restrictions”). The registra-
tion of shareholders in the Share Register or in the ADR 
register kept by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., does not 
affect the tradability of shares or ADRs.

Voting rights, restrictions and 
representation
REGISTRATION
Shareholders have the right to vote and to execute all 
other rights as granted under Swiss law and the Articles 
of Incorporation (see, in particular, articles 17 and 18 of 
the Articles of Incorporation).
Each share registered with the right to vote by the 
third business day before the General Meeting entitles 
the holder to one vote at General Meetings. Article 5, 
paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that 
to be registered with voting rights, shareholders must 
declare that they acquired the shares in their own name 
and for their own account. According to article 5, para-
graph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation, the Board may 
register nominees with the right to vote. The Share Reg-
ister is a non-public register subject to statutory confi-
dentiality and data privacy. 
The Articles of Incorporation are available at www.
novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corpo-
rate-governance.
REGISTRATION RESTRICTIONS
Article 5, paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation 
provides that no shareholder shall be registered with 
the right to vote for more than 2% of the share capital. 
Given that shareholder representation at General Meet-
ings has traditionally been comparatively low in Swit-
zerland, Novartis AG considers registration restrictions 
necessary to prevent a minority shareholder from domi-
nating a General Meeting. The Board may, upon request, 
grant an exemption. Considerations include if the share-
holder supports our goal of creating sustainable value 
and has a long-term investment horizon. Exemptions 
are in force for the registered shareholders listed in “—
Item 6.C Board practices—Group structure and share-
holders—Shareholders—Significant shareholders.” An 
exemption also applies to Norges Bank (Central Bank 
of Norway), Oslo, which as of December 31, 2024, was 
not registered but held 2.3% according to a disclosure 
notification filed with Novartis AG. No further exemptions 
were requested in 2024. The same restrictions indirectly 
apply to ADR holders. 
Article 5, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation 
provides that no nominee shall be registered with the 
right to vote for more than 0.5% of the registered share 
capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemp-
tion from this restriction if the nominee discloses the 
names, addresses and number of shares of the persons

According to article 5, paragraph 4 of the Articles of 
Incorporation, shareholders, ADR holders, or nominees 
who are linked to each other or who act in concert to cir-
cumvent registration restrictions are treated as one per-
son or nominee for the purposes of the restrictions on 
registration.
The registration restrictions may be changed by res-
olution of the General Meeting, with approval of at least 
two-thirds of the votes represented at the meeting.
The Articles of Incorporation are available at www.
novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corpo-
rate-governance.
ATTENDANCE, REPRESENTATION AND WEB PORTAL
Registered shareholders will receive a personal invita-
tion letter to the General Meetings with an access code 
to log in to our web portal, and – if the shareholder did 
not use the web portal in the past – a printed invitation 
brochure and a registration/proxy form. By  returning the 
registration/proxy form or using the web portal, share-
holders can order an admission ticket for the General 
Meeting or appoint a representative of their choice by 
means of a written proxy or the Independent Proxy to 
vote their shares on their behalf.
If the Independent Proxy is appointed, shareholders 
can also give voting instructions on agenda items or on 
alternative or additional motions related to the agenda 
items either (i) following the recommendations of the 
Board for such alternative or additional motions; or (ii) 
opposing such alternative or additional motions. They 
can also abstain from voting.
ADR HOLDERS
ADR holders have the rights enumerated in the deposit 
agreement (such as the right to give voting instruc-
tions and to receive dividends). The ADS depositary of 
Novartis AG – JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., New York – 
holds the shares underlying the ADRs and is registered 
as a shareholder in the Share Register. An ADR is not a 
share, and an ADR holder is not a Novartis AG shareholder. 
Each ADR represents one share. ADR holders exercise 
their voting rights by instructing the depositary to exer-
cise their voting rights. The ADS depositary exercises 
the voting rights for registered shares underlying ADRs 
for which no voting instructions have been given by pro-
viding a discretionary proxy to an uninstructed indepen-
dent designee. Such designee must be a shareholder.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
CONVENING 
The AGM must be held within six months of the end of our 
financial year (December 31), and normally takes place in late 
February or early March. According to article 12a of the 
Articles of Incorporation (www.novartis.com/investors/
company-overview/corporate-governance), the Board 
may foresee that shareholders who cannot be present at 
the venue of the AGM may exercise their rights through 
electronic means. The Board may at any time until June 
30, 20281 also order that the AGM be held electronically 
without a venue. Extraordinary General Meetings may be 
requested by the Board, the external auditor, or share-
holders representing at least 5% of the share capital.
AGENDA
Shareholders representing shares with an aggregate 
nominal value of at least CHF 1 million may request that 
an item be included in a General Meeting agenda. Such 
requests must be made in writing at least 45 days before 
the meeting, specifying the requested item and proposal. 
If an explanatory statement is to be included in the notice 
of meeting, it must be submitted within the same period, 
and formulated in a short, clear and concise manner.
POWERS
According to article 17 of the Articles of Incorporation 
(www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corpo-
rate-governance), the following powers are vested exclu-
sively in the General Meeting:
•	 Adoption and amendment of the Articles of Incorporation

Compensation Committee members, the Independent 
Proxy and the external auditor

purpose)
•	 Approval of the maximum aggregate compensation 
of the Board (from one AGM until the next AGM) and 
of the Executive Committee (for the financial year fol-
lowing the AGM). If the maximum aggregate amount of 
compensation already approved by the AGM is not suf-
ficient to cover the compensation of newly appointed 
or promoted Executive Committee members, Novartis 
may use up to 40% of the amount last approved for 
the newly appointed or promoted Executive Commit-
tee members
•	 Discharge of Board and Executive Committee mem-
bers
•	 Delisting of the shares of Novartis AG
•	 Decisions on other matters that are reserved by law or

1	In accordance with the statement by the Board issued on February 10, 2023, Novartis 
commits to submitting the corresponding authorization again to a shareholder vote at 
the 2025 Annual General Meeting, regardless of the time limitation stipulated in the 
Articles of Incorporation.

 Board of Directors
Election and term of office
Board members (including the Board Chair) and Com-
pensation Committee members are elected individually 
by shareholders at the General Meeting for a one-year 
term of office. The term of office expires at the end of 
the next AGM.
According to article 20, paragraph 3 of the Articles 
of Incorporation, a member shall not serve on the Board 
for more than 12 years. Under special circumstances and 
if deemed to be in the best interest of the Company, the 
Board may recommend exceptions to the shareholders 
(www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/cor-
porate-governance).
The term limit supports our commitment to renew the 
Board on an ongoing basis and follows international best 
practice. 
Succession planning
The GSNC prepares and reviews succession plans for the 
Board on an annual basis. These plans are discussed by 
the Board in private meetings. A search for a new Board 
member is launched – normally with the support of a pro-
fessional executive search company – with individual selec-
tion criteria defined based on the evolving needs of the 
Company and a continuing focus on diversity, skills and 
experience. The set of competencies (further explained in 
“—Item 6.C Board practices—Board of Directors—Board 
skills”) and a balance between continuity of experience 
and fresh perspectives are also important criteria for the 
GSNC when evaluating new candidates. Candidates are 
interviewed by the Board Chair, members of the GSNC, 
other Board members, and members of the Executive 
Committee. The GSNC then makes a recommendation 
to the full Board, and the Board ultimately decides who 
should be proposed for election at the upcoming AGM.
Independence
All Board members – including the Board Chair – are 
non-executive and independent, pursuant to applica-
ble corporate governance rules and Novartis indepen-
dence criteria, which are outlined in Appendix II to the 
Board Regulations (www.novartis.com/investors/com-
pany-overview/corporate-governance). In particular, no 
Board member is or was a member of the management 
of Novartis AG or of any other Novartis Group company 
in the last three financial years up to December 31, 2024, 
or has or had, a significant business relationship with 
Novartis AG or with any other Novartis Group company.
The independence of Board members is assessed 
annually. Each Board member completes an indepen-
dence questionnaire that is reviewed by the GSNC. The 
GSNC then submits a proposal to the full Board, and the 
Board determines the independence status of each Board 
member.
The Board members are also subject to procedures 
to avoid conflicts of interest which are outlined in the 
Board Regulations (www.novartis.com/investors/com-
pany-overview/corporate-governance). Based on such 
procedures, Simon Moroney did not participate in any 
discussions regarding the acquisition of MorphoSys AG 
and did not have access to any underlying documents.

 Diversity
Novartis is dedicated to fostering an inclusive Board 
where individuals from all genders and ethnic back-
grounds can thrive and contribute their unique insights. 
A diverse Board ensures that the appropriate balance of 
skills, expertise, experience, and cultural background is 
represented to discharge its responsibilities and to sup-
port long-term value creation for shareholders, patients, 
employees and other stakeholders.
Diversity remains a critical focus area for the Board, 
and the GSNC continuously examines opportunities to 
further increase the Board’s diversity when identifying 
new Board member candidates. The GSNC considers 
gender, age, nationality, ethnicity and viewpoints, profes-
sional background, and expertise in its selection process. 
Regarding gender diversity, the Board pledges to sus-
tain its efforts to achieve 50% representation of both 
genders in the composition of the Board, within a range 
of +/- 10%.
Board skills
Upon proposal by the GSNC, the Board has determined 
a diverse set of competencies for its members that aligns 
with our status as a listed company, as well as our busi-
ness portfolio, geographic reach and culture. Within 
this set of competencies, Board members were asked 
to identify their most relevant skills based on their edu-
cational background, professional experience and per-
sonal achievements. 
The GSNC assesses the set of competencies as well 
as the individual skills annually to ensure that an appro-
priate balance of skills, expertise, experience and diver-
sity is represented on the Board.
To learn more about our Board members and their 
individual skills, see “—Item 6.C Board practices—Board 
of Directors—Members of the Board of Directors.”

Questionnaire
•	 Each Board member fills out an 
anonymous survey. 
•	 A report identifying key strengths and 
challenges is produced for the Board 
and its committees.
Review
•	 Based on the results, the Board Chair 
and the committee chairs each lead a 
qualitative review with their colleagues 
and then with the entire Board.
• In addition, the Vice-Chair leads a 
qualitative review of the Board Chair’s 
performance, without the Chair being 
present, and then provides the Board 
Chair with the Board’s feedback.
Outcome
•	 The last self-assessment for 2024 
determined that the Board and its 
committees are functioning effectively 
and efficiently.
•	 The feedback confirmed that the Board 
has an open culture, where different 
views are encouraged and respected, 
and that the Board is prepared to adapt 
and change as circumstances require.
•	 The results also identified key areas 
on which to focus, such as further 
development of Novartis strategy, 
sustained innovation and product 
pipeline, as well as the impact of the 
current geopolitical situation including 
US and China. The evaluation also 
showed that the Board has a key 
focus on supporting the Board Chair 
transition.

Self-assessment
The Board and its committees conduct a self-assess-
ment once a year, covering topics including Board com-
position, purpose, scope and responsibilities; succession 
planning; Board processes and governance; interaction 
between the Board and the Executive Committee; Board 
meetings and pre-reading material; team effectiveness; 
and Board Chair and peer evaluation. Every third year, 
this process is conducted by an independent external 
consultant. 
The 2023 review was undertaken by the consulting 
firm Egon Zehnder and its results discussed with the 
Board of Directors and separately with the Executive 
Committee during the first half of 2024, where Egon 
Zehnder shared key observations and recommendations. 
The results of the 2023 in-depth assessment determined 
that Novartis has a Board that is performing well and 
improving, where Directors are highly engaged and have 
a good rapport, and where there is effective succession 
and rejuvenation in place. Feedback from management 
on the Board’s evaluation showed that the Executive 
Committee welcomes the interactions with the Board 
and its members, as well as the balanced supportive/
challenging dynamics and rich discussions. The report 
made several recommendations for the Board’s consid-
eration, including preparing for the transition to a new 
Board Chair in 2025 and areas where the Board should 
focus its attention in the future.
The 2024 self-assessment was conducted internally:
Trainings
The Board receives regular briefings and trainings on 
ethics, risks and compliance, ESG and other relevant 
topics. In 2024, each Board member completed train-
ing on the following: 
•	 The US Healthcare Ecosystem, by Adam Fein
•	 Adverse event refresher
•	 Code of Ethics  
•	 External partner risk management
•	 Antitrust / Fair Competition Policy updates
•	 “Fit to Commit”, which focused on anti-bribery, insider 
trading, conflicts of interest and D&I
•	 Data ethics and information management, covering key 
cybersecurity, information management and personal 
information risks, including AI use
Our Chief Legal Officer also provides regular updates to 
the Board members on developments related to insider 
trading laws and regulations and briefs members of the 
Board and the Executive Committee on an annual basis 
on their respective duties. In addition, the Company offers 
a broad range of external training to its Board members. 
Role of the Board and its committees
The Board is responsible for the overall direction 
and oversight of management, and holds the ultimate 
 decision-making authority, with the exception of deci-
sions reserved for shareholders. Board members are 
expected to commit the time and effort required to fulfil 
all their Board and committee responsibilities.
The Board has delegated certain duties and respon-
sibilities to its five committees led by a Board-elected 
committee chair, as set out in the Board Regulations 
(www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/cor-
porate-governance). In some cases, these responsibili-
ties are of an advisory or preparatory nature. In other 
cases, the committee has decision-making power that 
is subject to final Board approval, or the responsibilities 
have been fully delegated to the committee. All commit-
tees have the authority to retain external consultants.
Any Board member may request a Board or commit-
tee meeting and the inclusion of an agenda item. Before 
meetings, Board members receive materials to help them 
prepare for the discussions and to inform decision-mak-
ing.

Information and control systems 
The Board’s information and control systems vis-à-vis 
management include a steady flow of information from 
senior management; monthly financial reports; a compre-
hensive and integrated risk management framework; and 
the independent evaluation of our risk management and 
internal control framework by the Internal Audit function 
(see “Item 15. Controls and Procedures”).
Information from senior management
The Board ensures that it receives sufficient information 
from the Executive Committee through:
•	 Monthly CEO reporting (encompassing progress against 
company targets, including financial results) and fre-
quent communications from the CEO on current devel-
opments
•	 Executive Committee meeting minutes
•	 Regular meetings and teleconferences by the Board 
and/or Board committees with the CEO and/or other 
members of the Executive Committee (e.g., the CFO, 
the Chief Legal Officer, the Chief Ethics, Risk & Com-
pliance Officer), and regular meetings and teleconfer-
ences with senior management (e.g., the Chief Audit 
Officer)
•	 Information from Executive Committee members or 
other Novartis employees, and visits to Novartis sites
To obtain an outside view, the Board and/or Board com-
mittees occasionally invite external advisors (e.g., the 
independent advisor of the Compensation Committee, 
the external auditor) to attend a meeting and/or share 
their observations about a specific topic.
Monthly financial reports
Novartis produces comprehensive, consolidated (unau-
dited) financial statements on a monthly basis for the 
Company. These are typically available no more than 10 
days after the end of the month, and include the following:
•	 Consolidated income statement of the month and year 
to date, in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, 
as well as adjustments to arrive at core results that are 
not aligned with IFRS measures, as defined by Novartis 
(see “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Pros-
pects—Item 5.A Operating results—Non-IFRS measures 
as defined by Novartis”). The IFRS Accounting Stan-
dards and core figures that are not aligned with IFRS 
measures are compared with the prior-year period and 
targets in both USD and on a constant currency basis.
•	 Supplementary data on a monthly and year-to-date 
basis, such as free cash flow and earnings per share 
on a USD basis 
Management information related to the consolidated 
income statements and free cash flow is made available 
to Board members through the monthly CEO Report, 
which includes an analysis of key deviations from the 
prior year or target.
Prior to the release of each quarter’s results, the Board 
receives the actual consolidated financial statement infor-
mation and an outlook of the full-year results in accor-
dance with IFRS Accounting Standards and core results 
that are not aligned with IFRS measures (as defined by 
Novartis), together with related commentary.
Annually, during the third quarter, the Board approves 
the Company’s strategic plan for the next three years. In 
the fourth quarter of the year, the Board approves the 
operating targets for the following year as well as the 
financial targets for the following three-year period, 
including a projected consolidated income statement in 
USD prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Stan-
dards and non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis 
(core results).
The Board does not have direct access to the Novartis 
financial and management reporting systems but can, at 
any time, request more detailed information.

ETHICS, RISK & COMPLIANCE
•	 Governs the Novartis Code of Ethics
•	 Provides an integrated ERM framework (which is described in the 
following section)
•	 Governs the global compliance program within Novartis
•	 Administers the Enterprise Policy Management and global Internal 
Controls framework
SENIOR LEADERS OF ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS AND GLOBAL 
FUNCTIONS, AT ALL LEVELS
•	 Provide appropriate risk management within their area of 
responsibility
•	 Establish adequate risk prevention and mitigation strategies when 
risk exposure is identified, including tracking progress and providing 
resources for possible actions
•	 Assess emerging risks, trends and overall exposure as part of the 
ERM process
Enterprise Risk Management framework
The Ethics, Risk & Compliance (ERC) function provides 
an integrated ERM framework to obtain a holistic view of 
Company risks and drive a culture of smart risk-taking. 
Under the leadership of the Chief Ethics, Risk & Com-
pliance Officer, the Corporate ERC team is responsible 
for the overall ERM process which is a fundamental pillar 
of our Integrated Assurance. This process covers, but is 
not limited to, risks associated with: 
•	 The research, development, manufacturing, marketing 
and sales of products
•	 Finance, taxes, intellectual property, compliance with 
law and regulations, security, product safety, technol-
ogy, human resources, and health, safety and environ-
mental protection
•	 Business objectives and strategies, including mergers 
and acquisitions
•	 External factors (e.g. risk amplifiers) such as the social, 
political and economic environment
The ERM process continued to evolve in 2024. The Cor-
porate ERC team conducted risk workshops and collab-
orated with all risk assurance and monitoring functions 
to identify key risks across the Company. Each Novartis 
unit organized a focused risk workshop including leader-
ship team members. In parallel, risk workshops were held 
in top countries by revenue and in certain focus markets. 
Once key risks were identified, mitigation action plans 
were created to address them in an effective way. The 
findings from these workshops were consolidated into 
the Novartis Risk Radar, which enables senior manage-
ment, the Executive Committee and the Board to focus 
discussions on key risks and more closely align our corpo-
rate strategy with our risk exposure and ways of working.
In 2024, the Corporate ERC team further developed 
the ERM framework within the Novartis Corporate ERC 
organization. We developed additional risk management 
training and launched our risk intelligence forum, an event 
that brought together internal and external speakers to 
address emerging trends and threats. We also integrated 
a critical scope of activities (Trade Sanctions Gover-
nance) into the Corporate ERC team. Furthermore, steady 
progress has been made in our Integrated Assurance 
journey by creating a holistic control framework linked 
to enterprise policies, and by further strengthening our 
Corporate ERC Assurance team by integrating Labor 
Rights and Data Privacy External Partner Audits to ensure 
a harmonized and coordinated monitoring process across 
the Company.
SpeakUp Office
Our SpeakUp Office provides a safe place for employ-
ees to report potential misconduct, including the option 
to do so anonymously. 
Global Security
Global Security proactively collects and shares threat 
intelligence to protect Novartis from situations that may 
compromise the safety of people, products and assets, 
and/or the reputation of our organization. Global Security 
protects patients from counterfeit products and, as part 
of the SpeakUp process, performs fair and timely inves-
tigations into high-risk cases of alleged internal miscon-
duct. It also provides personal security advice and sup-
port for Novartis executives and other employees with 
the utmost discretion.

Internal Audit cycle methodology 
includes:
	O Discovery (planning): Ongoing moni-
toring and information gathering 
through continuous risk assessments, 
utilizing business interviews, and bian-
nual calibration of the audit plan. The 
plan is reviewed and approved by the 
Audit Committee (ACC) every six 
months.
	O Execution and Reporting: 37 engage-
ments delivered in 2024, all linked to 
group risks, emerging topics and com-
pany-wide initiatives.
	O Follow Up: Management is responsible 
for resolving issues, supported by 
Internal Audit to ensure timely closure 
of high-risk observations.

Internal Audit
Internal Audit Purpose and Function
The Internal Audit function supports the Board and Exec-
utive Committee by providing independent assurance. It 
evaluates the effectiveness, efficiency, and adequacy of 
processes and controls, ensuring that Novartis meets its 
strategic objectives, manages major risks, and complies 
with applicable policies, laws, and regulations.
The Chief Audit Officer (CAO) reports administra-
tively to the CEO and functionally to the Chair of the Audit 
and Compliance Committee (ACC). The CAO meets with 
the ACC at least quarterly and annually reaffirms the 
organizational independence of the Internal Audit func-
tion to the ACC.
In 2024, Internal Audit executed a risk-based audit 
plan, with results reported to audited units, the Execu-
tive Committee, and the ACC. Audit findings and action 
plans are centralized to ensure efficient follow-up. To the 
right is a summary of the audits and advisory activities 
conducted in 2024, along with key methodology steps 
for managing the Internal Audit cycle.
  
Internal Audit performed 95% of planned activities (equat-
ing to 76 of 80 engagements) in 2024.

Auditors
Duration of the mandate 
and terms of office
On behalf of the Board, the ACC selects and nominates 
an independent auditor for election at the AGM. KPMG 
commenced its auditing mandate for Novartis in 2022. 
Richard Broadbelt, Auditor in charge, and Heidi Broom-
Hirst, Global Audit Partner, began serving in their roles 
in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The ACC together with 
KPMG will ensure that these partners are rotated at least 
every five years. 
Auditing fees and additional fees
The ACC monitors and preapproves the fees paid to the 
external auditor for all audit and non-audit services. It 
has developed and approved a policy with clear guide-
lines on the engagement of the independent auditor firm. 
This policy is designed to help ensure that the indepen-
dence of the external auditor is maintained. It limits the 
scope of services that the external auditor may provide 
to the Company, stipulating certain permissible types of 
audit-related and non-audit services, including tax ser-
vices and other services that have been preapproved by 
the ACC. The ACC preapproves all other services on a 
case-by-case basis. 
The external auditor is required to report periodically 
to the ACC about the scope of the services it has pro-
vided to the Company and the fees for the services it 
has performed to date. KPMG fees for professional ser-
vices related to the 12-month periods ended December 
31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, are as follows:

Audit services include work performed to issue opinions 
on consolidated financial statements and parent  company 
financial statements of Novartis AG, to issue opinions 
related to the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
control over financial reporting, and to issue reports on 
local statutory financial statements. Also included are 
audit services that can generally only be provided by the 
statutory auditor, such as the audits of the Compensa-
tion Report, special purpose financial statement in con-
nection with divestment transactions, information sys-
tems and the related control environment; and reviews 
of quarterly financial results.
Audit-related services include other assurance 
­services provided by the independent auditor but not 
restricted to those that can only be provided by the 
­statutory auditor. They include services such as: limited 
assurance on selected sustainability information in the 
Novartis in Society Integrated Report, audits of pension 
and other employee benefit plans; audit services in con-
nection with non-recurring transactions; assurance of 
the Compensation Report of Novartis; and other audit-re-
lated services.
Tax services include tax compliance and assistance 
with historical tax matters.
Other services include license fees for use of account-
ing and other reporting guidance databases and, in 2024, 
additionally procedures related to training on emerging 
topics and benchmarking studies.
Information to the Board and the ACC
The ACC, acting on behalf of the Board, is responsible for 
overseeing the activities of the external auditor. In 2024, 
this committee held seven meetings. KPMG was invited to 
all of these meetings to attend the discussions on audit-
ing matters and any other matters relevant to its audit.
The ACC recommended to the Board to approve the 
audited consolidated financial statements and the sep-
arate parent company financial statements of Novartis AG 
for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Board pro-
posed the acceptance of these financial statements for 
approval by the shareholders at the next AGM.
The ACC regularly evaluates the performance of the 
external auditor and, based on this, once a year deter-
mines whether the external auditor should be proposed 
to the shareholders for re-election. To assess the per-
formance of the external auditor, the ACC requests input 
from management and holds private meetings with the 
CFO and the Chief Audit Officer and, if necessary, obtains 
an independent external assessment. Criteria applied 
for the performance assessment of the external auditor 
include an evaluation of: its technical and operational 
competence; its independence and objectivity; the suf-
ficiency of the resources it has employed; its focus on 
areas of significant risk to Novartis; its willingness to 
probe and challenge; its ability to provide effective, prac-
tical recommendations; and the openness and effective-
ness of its communications and coordination with the 
ACC, the Internal Audit function and management. 
Once a year, the Auditor in charge and the Global 
Audit Partner report to the Board on the external audi-
tor’s activities during the current year, and on the audit 
plan for the coming year. 
On an annual basis, the external auditor provides the 
ACC with written disclosures required by the US Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the commit-
tee and the external auditor discuss the external audi-
tor’s independence from Novartis.

Novartis shares are widely held. As of December 31, 2024, 
Novartis had approximately 186 000 shareholders listed 
in the Share Register of Novartis, representing approxi-
mately 55.5% of issued shares. Based on the Novartis 
Share Register and excluding treasury shares, approxi-
mately 56.5% of the shares registered by name were held

9.7% of our share capital held as treasury shares by 
Novartis AG or its fully owned subsidiaries (including Swiss 
foundations controlled by Novartis AG), and 34.4% were

Based on the Share Register, we believe that we are 
not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another 
corporation or government, or by any other natural or 
legal persons. There are no arrangements that may result 
in a change of control.

Item 8.  Financial Information
8.A Consolidated statements and other financial 
information
See “Item 18. Financial Statements.”
Dividend policy
Subject to the dividend policy described below, our 
Board of Directors expects to recommend the payment 
of a dividend in respect of each financial year. If approved 
by our shareholders at the relevant annual shareholders’ 
meeting, the dividends will be payable shortly following 
such approval. Any shareholder who purchases our 
shares before the ex‑dividend date and holds the shares 
until that date shall be deemed to be entitled to receive 
the dividends approved at that meeting. Dividends are 
reflected in our financial statements in the year in which 
they are approved by our shareholders.
Our dividend policy is to pay a growing annual divi-
dend in Swiss francs per share. This policy is subject to 
our financial conditions and outlook at the time, the 
results of our operations, and other factors.
The Board will propose a dividend of CHF 3.50 per 
share to the shareholders for approval at the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting to be held on March 7, 2025. Because we pay 
dividends in Swiss francs, exchange rate fluctuations will 
affect the US dollar amounts received by holders of ADRs. 
For the amount of dividends we paid in the past three years, 
see “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 18. Equity.” 
Disclosure pursuant to Section 219 of 
the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria 
Human Rights Act (ITRA)
At Novartis, our purpose is to reimagine medicine to 
improve and extend people’s lives, regardless of where 
they live. This includes the compliant sale of medicines 
and other healthcare products worldwide. To help us ful-
fill this mission, we have for many years maintained a 
branch office located in Iran.
As of October 18, 2010, a non‑US Novartis affiliate 
entered into a non‑binding Memorandum of Understand-
ing (MoU) with the Ministry of Health and Medical Educa-
tion of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Pursuant to the MoU, 
the Iranian Ministry of Health acknowledges certain ben-
efits that may apply to sales of certain of our medicines 
by third‑party distributors in Iran. These include fast‑track 
registration, market exclusivity, end‑user subsidies, and 
exemptions from customs tariffs. Novartis receives no 
payments from the Iranian Ministry of Health under the 
MoU, and the MoU creates no obligations on the part of 
either Novartis or the Iranian Ministry of Health.
From time to time, including in 2024, certain Novartis 
non‑US affiliates made payments to government entities 
in Iran related to patents, trademarks and exit fees. 
From time to time, including in 2024, certain Novartis 
non‑US affiliates enter into agreements with hospitals, 
research institutes, medical associations and universi-
ties in Iran to provide grants and sponsor congresses, 
seminars and symposia, and with doctors and other 
healthcare professionals for consulting services, includ-
ing participation in advisory boards and investigator ser-
vices for observational (non‑interventional) studies. 
Some hospitals and research institutes are owned or 
controlled by the government of Iran, and some doctors 
and healthcare professionals are employed by hospitals 
that may be public or government‑owned.
Because we have operations in Iran, including employ-
ees, we obtain services and have other dealings inciden-
tal to our activities in that country, including paying taxes 
and salaries either directly or indirectly through a ser-
vice provider, and obtaining office rentals, insurance, 
electricity, water and telecommunications services, 
office and similar supplies, and customs‑related services 
from Iranian companies that may be owned or controlled 
by the government of Iran. In addition, from time to time, 
representatives of our non-US affiliates participate in 
meetings with Iranian officials to discuss issues relevant 
to our business and the pharmaceutical industry.
Certain Novartis non-US affiliates maintain local 
accounts at banks that are, as of November 5, 2018, on 
the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons 
List (SDN List). These non-US affiliates make local trans-
actions for employee payroll and local vendor payment 
purposes. These transactions are conducted for the pur-
pose of facilitating the provision of medicine to Iran, in line 
with the humanitarian exceptions contained in Section 11 
of Executive Order 13902 and other applicable sanctions 
legal authorities. No transactions are made with an Iranian 
financial institution designated on the SDN List in connec-
tion with Iran’s support for international terrorism or pro-
liferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Not applicable.
10.B Memorandum and articles of association
The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain 
provisions of our Articles of Incorporation (“Articles”); 
the Board Regulations; and Swiss law, particularly the 
Swiss Code of Obligations (“Swiss CO”), and is qualified 
in its entirety by reference to the Articles and the Board 
Regulations, which are an exhibit to the Form 20‑F, and 
to Swiss law.
10.B.1 Company purpose
Novartis AG is registered in the commercial register of 
the canton of Basel‑Stadt, Switzerland, under number 
CHE‑103.867.266. Our business purpose, as stated in 
Article 2 of the Articles, is to hold interests in enterprises 
in the area of healthcare or nutrition. We may also hold 
interests in enterprises in the areas of biology, chemis-
try, physics, information technology or related areas. We 
may acquire, mortgage, liquidate or sell real estate and 
intellectual property rights in Switzerland or abroad. In 
pursuing our business purpose, we strive to create sus-
tainable value.
10.B.2 Directors
According to our Articles, the Board of Directors 
(“Board”) consists of a minimum of eight and a maximum 
of 16 members. The members of the Board (including the 
Board Chair) are elected individually by the General 
Meeting of Shareholders (“General Meeting”) for a one-
year term of office lasting until the completion of the next 
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (“AGM”).
(a) 	A Board resolution requires the affirmative majority 
of the votes cast. According to our Board Regulations, 
a member of our Board (“Director”) may not partici-
pate in decisions and resolutions on matters that 
affect, or reasonably might affect, the Director’s inter-
ests or the interests of a person close to the Director 
(but the Director may participate in the discussion). 
(b)	Compensation of the Directors is subject to the 
approval of the aggregate amounts of such compen-
sation by a shareholders’ resolution under the Swiss 
CO.
(c)	The Articles prohibit the granting of loans or credits 
to Directors.
(d)	The Articles provide that a Director shall not serve on 
the Board for more than 12 years. The Board may, 
under certain circumstances and if deemed in the 
best interests of the Company, recommend excep-
tions to this rule to the General Meeting.  
(e)	Our Directors are not required to be shareholders at 
the time of the election by the General Meeting. How-
ever, according to our share ownership guidelines, to 
ensure their interests are aligned with those of our 
shareholders, the Board Chair is required to own a 
minimum of 30 000 Novartis AG shares, and other 
Directors are required to own at least 5 000 Novartis 
AG shares within five years of having joined the Board.
10.B.3 Shareholder rights
Because Novartis AG has only one class of registered 
shares, the following information applies to all sharehold-
ers.
(a)	Under the Swiss CO, we may only pay dividends out 
of balance sheet profits or out of distributable 
reserves. In any event, under the Swiss CO, while the 
Board may propose that a dividend be paid, we may 
only pay dividends upon shareholders’ approval at a 
General Meeting. Furthermore, the Swiss CO requires 
us to accrue general legal reserves under certain cir-
cumstances so long as these reserves amount to less 
than 20% of our registered share capital, and Swiss 
law and the Articles permit us to accrue additional 
reserves beyond the statutory reserves. Our auditors 
must confirm that the dividend proposal of our Board 
conforms with the Swiss CO and the Articles. Our 
Board expects to recommend the payment of a divi-
dend in respect of each financial year. See “Item 6. 
Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Item 
6.C Board Practices—Capital Structure—Limitation 
on transferability—Per-share information” and 
“Item  8.  Financial Information—Item  8.A. Consoli-
dated statements and other financial information—
Dividend policy.”
Dividends are usually due and payable shortly after 
the shareholders have passed a resolution approving 
the payment. Dividends that have not been claimed 
within five years after the due date revert to us and are 
allocated to our general reserves. For information 
about deduction of the withholding tax or other duties 
from dividend payments, see “—Item 10.E Taxation.”

Item 10.  Additional Information

(b)	Each share is entitled to one vote at a General Meet-
ing. Voting rights may only be exercised for shares 
registered with the right to vote on the record date 
for the applicable General Meeting. To do so, the 
shareholder must file a share registration form with 
us, setting forth the shareholder’s name, address and 
citizenship (or, in the case of a legal entity, its regis-
tered office). If the shareholder has not timely regis-
tered its shares, then the shareholder may not vote 
at, or participate in, a General Meeting.
To vote its shares, the shareholder must also 
explicitly declare that it has acquired the shares in its 
own name and for its own account. If the shareholder 
refuses to make such a declaration, the shares may 
not be voted unless the Board recognizes such share-
holder as a nominee.
The Articles provide that no shareholder shall be 
registered with the right to vote shares comprising 
more than 2% of the registered share capital. The 
Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from 
this restriction. Considerations include whether the 
shareholder supports our goal of creating sustainable 
value and has a long‑term investment horizon. Fur-
thermore, the Articles provide that no nominee shall 
be registered with the right to vote shares compris-
ing more than 0.5% of the registered share capital. 
The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption 
from this restriction if the nominee discloses the 
names, addresses, and number of shares of the per-
sons for whose account it holds 0.5% or more of the 
registered share capital. The same restrictions indi-
rectly apply to ADR holders. We have in the past 
granted exemptions from the 2% rule for sharehold-
ers and the 0.5% rule for nominees. 
For purposes of the 2% rule for shareholders and 
the 0.5% rule for nominees, groups of companies and 
groups of shareholders acting in concert are consid-
ered to be one shareholder. These rules also apply to 
shares acquired or subscribed by the exercise of sub-
scription, option or conversion rights.
After hearing the registered shareholder or nom-
inee, the Board may cancel, with retroactive effect as 
of the date of registration, the registration of the 
shareholders if the registration was effected based 
on false information.
Registration restrictions in the Articles may only be 
removed upon a resolution carrying a two‑thirds major-
ity of the votes represented at a General Meeting.
Except as noted below, shareholders’ resolutions 
require the approval of an absolute majority of the 
votes present at a General Meeting. As a result, 
abstentions have the effect of votes against such res-
olutions. Some examples of shareholders’ resolutions 
requiring a vote by such “absolute majority of the 
votes” are: 
•	 Adoption and amendment of the Articles 
•	 Election and removal of the Board Chair, the Board 
and Compensation Committee members, the Inde-
pendent Proxy and the external auditor
•	 Approval of the management report, the consoli-
dated financial statements and the report on non-fi-
nancial matters
•	 Approval of the financial statements of Novartis AG, 
and the decision on the appropriation of available 
earnings shown on the balance sheet, in particular 
with regard to dividends (including any repayment 
of the statutory capital reserves and the approval 
of interim dividends and the interim financial state-
ments required for such purpose), if any
•	 Approval of the maximum aggregate compensation 
of the Board (from an AGM until the next AGM) and 
of the Executive Committee (for the financial year 
following the AGM)
•	 Discharge of Board and Executive Committee 
members from liability for matters disclosed to the 
General Meeting
•	 Decision on other matters that are reserved by law 
or by the Articles (e.g., advisory vote on the Com-
pensation Report) to the General Meeting
According to the Articles and Swiss law, the fol-
lowing matters require the approval of a “superma-
jority” of at least two‑thirds of the votes present at a 
General Meeting: 
•	 Alteration of the purpose of Novartis AG
•	 The consolidation of shares, unless the approval of 
all affected shareholders is required
•	 Increase of the share capital out of equity, by con-
tributions in kind or by way of set-off against receiv-
able, or the grant of special rights
•	 Restriction or cancellation of subscription rights
•	 Introduction of a conditional capital or capital band
•	 Creation of shares with increased voting powers
•	 Implementation of restrictions on the transfer of 
registered shares, and the removal of such restric-
tions
•	 Change of the currency of the share capital
•	 Introduction of the deciding vote for the presiding 
officer at the General Meeting
•	 A provision in the Articles allowing the General 
Meeting to be held abroad
•	 Delisting of the shares of the Company
•	 Change of the registered office of Novartis AG
•	 Introduction of an arbitration clause in the Articles 
•	 Merger, split or transformation of Novartis AG under 
the Swiss Merger Act (subject to mandatory statu-
tory provisions)
•	 Dissolution of Novartis AG

Our shareholders are required, on an annual basis, 
to elect all Directors (including the Board Chair), the 
Compensation Committee members, the external 
auditor and the Independent Proxy. The Articles do 
not provide for cumulative voting of shares.
At a General Meeting, shareholders can be repre-
sented by a legal representative or, by means of a writ-
ten proxy, by a representative of choice. Furthermore, 
a shareholder may be represented by the Indepen-
dent Proxy. Votes are taken either by a show of hands 
or by electronic voting, unless the General Meeting 
resolves to have a ballot or where a ballot is ordered 
by the chair of the meeting. ADSs, each representing 
one Novartis AG share and evidenced by ADRs, are 
issued by our depositary JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 
New York, and not by us. The ADR is vested with rights 
defined and enumerated in the Deposit Agreement 
(such as the rights to vote, to receive a dividend and 
to receive a share of Novartis AG in exchange for a 
certain number of ADRs). The enumeration of rights, 
including any limitations on those rights in the Deposit 
Agreement, is final. There are no other rights given to 
the ADR holders. Only the ADS depositary, holding 
our shares underlying the ADRs, is registered as 
shareholder in our share register. An ADR is not a 
Novartis AG share, and an ADR holder is not a Novartis 
AG shareholder.
The Deposit Agreement between our depositary, 
the ADR holder and us has granted certain indirect 
rights to vote to the ADR holders. ADR holders may 
not attend a General Meeting in person. ADR holders 
exercise their voting rights by instructing JPMorgan 
Chase Bank, N.A., our depositary, to exercise the vot-
ing rights attached to the registered shares underly-
ing the ADRs. Each ADR represents one Novartis AG 
share. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., exercises the vot-
ing rights for registered shares underlying ADRs for 
which no voting instructions have been given by pro-
viding a discretionary proxy to an uninstructed inde-
pendent designee. Such designee has to be a share-
holder of Novartis AG. The same voting restrictions 
apply to ADR holders as to those holding Novartis AG 
shares (i.e., the right to vote up to 2% of the Novartis 
AG registered share capital – unless otherwise 
granted an exemption by the Board – and the disclo-
sure requirement for nominees).
(c)	Shareholders have the right to allocate the profit 
shown on our balance sheet and to distribute divi-
dends by vote taken at the General Meeting, subject 
to the legal requirements described above.
(d)	Under the Swiss CO, any surplus arising out of a liq-
uidation of Novartis AG (i.e., after the settlement of all 
claims of all creditors) would be distributed to the 
shareholders in proportion to the paid‑in nominal 
value of their shares.
(e)	The Swiss CO limits a corporation’s ability to hold or 
repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries 
may only repurchase shares if we have sufficient 
freely disposable equity in the amount of the pur-
chase price of the acquired shares. The aggregate 
nominal value of all Novartis AG shares held by us and 
our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our regis-
tered share capital. However, it is accepted that a 
Swiss corporation may repurchase its own shares 
beyond the statutory limit of 10% if the repurchased 
shares are clearly earmarked for cancellation. In addi-
tion, we are required to recognize a negative position, 
or if our subsidiaries acquire our shares, to create a 
special reserve on our balance sheet in the amount 
of the purchase price of the acquired shares. Repur-
chased shares held by us or our subsidiaries do not 
carry any rights to vote at a General Meeting but are 
entitled to the economic benefits generally con-
nected with the shares. 
Under the Swiss CO, we may not cancel treasury 
shares without the approval of a capital reduction by 
our shareholders given that shareholders have not 
approved the introduction of a capital band.
(f)	 Not applicable.
(g)	Since all of our issued and outstanding shares have 
been fully paid in, our shareholders are not obliged to 
make further contributions with respect to their shares. 
(h)	See “—Item  10.B.3(b) Shareholder rights” and “—
Item 10.B.7 Change in control.”
10.B.4 Changes to shareholder rights
Under the Swiss CO, we may not issue new shares with-
out the prior approval of a capital increase by our share-
holders. If a capital increase is approved, then our share-
holders would generally have certain pre-emptive rights 
to obtain newly issued shares in an amount proportional 
to the nominal value of the shares they already hold. 
These pre-emptive rights could be excluded in certain 
limited circumstances with the approval of a resolution 
adopted at a General Meeting by a supermajority of 
two‑thirds of the votes. In addition, we may not create 
shares with increased voting powers or place restrictions 
on the transfer of registered shares without the approval 
of a resolution adopted at a General Meeting by a super-
majority of votes. In addition, see “—Item 10.B.3(b) Share-
holder rights” with regard to the Board’s ability to cancel 
the registration of shares under limited circumstances.
10.B.5 Shareholder meetings
Under the Swiss CO and the Articles, we must hold an 
AGM within six months after the end of our financial year. 
A General Meeting may be convened by the Board or, if 
necessary, by the external auditor. The Board is further 
required to convene an extraordinary General Meeting 
if so resolved by a General Meeting, or if so requested 
by shareholders by signed petition representing at least 
5% of the share capital, specifying the items for the 
agenda and their proposals. Shareholders representing 
shares with an aggregate nominal value of at least 
CHF 1 000 000 may request that an item be included in 
a General Meeting agenda. A General Meeting is con-
vened by publishing a notice in the Swiss Official Gazette 
of Commerce (Schweizerisches Handelsamtsblatt) at 
least 20 days prior to such meeting. Shareholders may 
also be informed by mail. Neither the Swiss CO nor the 
Articles require a quorum for a General Meeting. In addi-
tion, see “—Item 10.B.3(b) Shareholder rights” regarding 
conditions for exercising a shareholder’s right to vote at 
a General Meeting.

10.B.6 Limitations
There are no limitations under the Swiss CO or our Arti-
cles on the right of non‑Swiss residents or nationals to 
own or vote shares other than the restrictions applica-
ble to all shareholders and holders of ADRs described 
in “—Item 10.B.3(b) Shareholder rights.”
10.B.7 Change in control
The Articles and the Board Regulations contain no pro-
vision that would have an effect of delaying, deferring or 
preventing a change in control of Novartis AG and that 
would operate only with respect to a merger, acquisition 
or corporate restructuring involving us or any of our sub-
sidiaries.
According to the Swiss Merger Act, shareholders 
may pass a resolution to merge with another corpora-
tion at any time. Such a resolution would require the con-
sent of at least two‑thirds of all votes present at the nec-
essary General Meeting.
Under the Swiss Financial Market Infrastructure Act, 
shareholders and groups of shareholders acting in con-
cert who acquire more than 33 1/3% of our shares would 
be under an obligation to make an offer to acquire all 
remaining Novartis AG shares. Novartis AG has neither 
opted out from the mandatory takeover offer obligation 
nor opted to increase the threshold for mandatory take-
over offers in its Articles.
10.B.8 Disclosure of shareholdings
Under the Swiss Financial Market Infrastructure Act, per-
sons who directly, indirectly or in concert with other 
parties acquire or dispose of our shares or purchase or 
sale rights relating to our shares are required to notify 
us and the SIX of the level of their holdings whenever 
such holdings reach, exceed or fall below certain thresh-
olds – 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 33 1/3%, 50% and 
66 2/3% – of the voting rights represented by our share 
capital (whether exercisable or not). This also applies to 
anyone who has discretionary power to exercise voting 
rights associated with our shares. Following receipt of 
such notification, we are required to inform the public by 
publishing the information via the electronic publication 
platform operated by the SIX.
An additional disclosure obligation exists under rules 
of the SIX that requires us to disclose  the identity of all 
of our shareholders (or related groups of shareholders) 
as published pursuant to the paragraph above, in Item 
6.C of this Annual Report. See “Item 6. Directors, Senior 
Management and Employees—Item 6.C Board prac-
tices—Group structure and shareholders—Sharehold-
ers—Significant shareholders.”
10.B.9 Differences in the law
See the references to Swiss law throughout this “—
Item 10.B Memorandum and articles of association.”
10.B.10 Changes in capital
The requirements of the Articles regarding changes in 
capital are not more stringent than the requirements of 
Swiss law.
10.C Material contracts 
Sandoz Spin-Off
In connection with the spin-off of Sandoz, we entered 
into a Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated Sep-
tember 30, 2023, a Tax Matters Agreement, dated Sep-
tember 30, 2023 and several other agreements with 
Sandoz to effect the separation of the Sandoz business 
and provide a framework for our relationship with Sandoz 
after the spin-off.
The Separation and Distribution Agreement sets 
forth the parties’ agreements regarding the principal 
actions to be taken in connection with the separation of 
the Sandoz business and the spin-off, by way of a distri-
bution of shares of Sandoz Group AG by Novartis AG to 
Novartis shareholders, including the conditions of the 
spin-off and the rights and obligations of the parties with 
respect to the separation and distribution. The Separa-
tion and Distribution Agreement identifies the assets to 
be transferred, liabilities to be assumed and contracts 
to be assigned to each of Novartis and Sandoz as part 
of the internal transactions effected prior to the 
distribution and provides for when and how such trans-
fers, assumptions and assignments should occur. Each 
party agreed to indemnify the other and each of the oth-
er’s directors, officers, managers, members, agents and 
employees against certain liabilities incurred in connec-
tion with the spin-off and the parties’ respective busi-
nesses (subject to certain exceptions).
The Tax Matters Agreement imposes certain restric-
tions and indemnity obligations on Sandoz designed to 
preserve the tax-neutral nature of the spin-off for Swiss 
tax and US federal income tax purposes. 
The Tax Matters Agreement also provides that 
Sandoz will be liable for any taxes accruing in the ordi-
nary course of business of Novartis and its subsidiaries 
before the spin-off if such taxes are attributable to enti-
ties which are transferred or allocated to the Sandoz 
Group as part of the spin-off, whereas Novartis will 
remain liable for any other taxes accruing before the 
spin-off in the ordinary course of business, to the extent 
not attributed to Sandoz.

10.D Exchange controls
There are no Swiss governmental laws, decrees or reg-
ulations that affect – in a manner material to Novartis AG 
– the export or import of capital, including the availabil-
ity of cash and cash equivalents for use by Novartis or 
any foreign exchange controls that affect the remittance 
of dividends, interest or other payments to non‑residents 
or non‑citizens of Switzerland who hold Novartis AG 
securities. 
10.E Taxation
The taxation discussion set forth below is intended only 
as a descriptive summary and does not purport to be a 
complete analysis or listing of all potential tax effects rel-
evant to the ownership or disposition of our shares or 
ADRs. The statements of US and Swiss tax laws set forth 
below are based on the laws and regulations in force as 
of the date of this 20‑F—including the current Conven-
tion Between the US and the Swiss Confederation for 
the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes 
on Income, entered into force on December 19, 1997 (the 
Treaty); the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended (the Code); Treasury regulations; rulings; judi-
cial decisions; and administrative pronouncements—and 
may be subject to any changes in US and Swiss law, and 
in any double taxation convention or treaty between the 
US and Switzerland occurring after that date, which 
changes may have retroactive effect.
Swiss taxation
Swiss residents
Withholding Tax on dividends and distributions. Dividends 
that we pay and similar cash or in‑kind distributions that 
we may make to a holder of shares or ADRs (including 
distributions of liquidation proceeds in excess of the 
nominal value, stock dividends and, under certain cir-
cumstances, proceeds from repurchases of shares by 
us in excess of the nominal value) are generally subject 
to a Swiss federal withholding tax (the Withholding Tax) 
at a current rate of 35%. Under certain circumstances, 
distributions out of capital contribution reserves made 
by shareholders after December 31, 1996, are exempt 
from the Withholding Tax. We are required to withhold 
Withholding Tax due from the gross distribution and to 
pay the Withholding Tax to the Swiss Federal Tax Admin-
istration. The Withholding Tax is refundable in full to 
Swiss tax residents who are the beneficial owners of the 
taxable distribution at the time it is resolved and duly 
report the gross distribution received on their personal 
tax return or in their financial statements for tax pur-
poses, as the case may be.
Income tax on dividends. A Swiss tax resident who 
receives dividends and similar distributions (including 
stock dividends and liquidation surplus) on shares or 
ADRs is required to include such amounts in the share-
holder’s personal income tax return. However, 
distributions out of qualified capital contribution reserves 
are not subject to income tax. A corporate shareholder 
may claim substantial relief from taxation of dividends 
and similar distributions received if the shares held rep-
resent a fair market value of at least CHF 1 million.
Capital gains tax upon disposal of shares. Under current 
Swiss tax law, the gain realized on shares held by a Swiss 
resident who holds shares or ADRs as part of his private 
property is generally not subject to any federal, cantonal 
or municipal income taxation on gains realized on the 
sale or other disposal of shares or ADRs. However, gains 
realized upon a repurchase of shares by us may be char-
acterized as taxable dividend income if certain condi-
tions are met. Book gains realized on shares or ADRs 
held by a Swiss corporate entity or by a Swiss resident 
individual as part of the shareholder’s business property 
are, in general, included in the taxable income of such 
person. However, the Federal Law on the Direct Federal 
Tax of December 14, 1990, and several cantonal laws on 
direct cantonal taxes provide for exceptions for Swiss 
corporate entities holding more than 10% of our voting 
stock for more than one year.
Residents of other countries
Recipients of dividends and similar distributions on our 
shares who are neither residents of Switzerland for tax 
purposes nor hold shares as part of a business con-
ducted through a permanent establishment situated in 
Switzerland (Non‑Resident Holders) are not subject to 
Swiss income taxes in respect of such distributions. 
Moreover, gains realized by such recipients upon the dis-
posal of shares are not subject to Swiss income taxes.
Non‑Resident Holders of shares are, however, sub-
ject to the Withholding Tax on dividends and similar dis-
tributions mentioned above and, under certain circum-
stances, to the Stamp Duty described below. Such 
Non‑Resident Holders may be entitled to a partial refund 
of the Withholding Tax if the country in which they reside 
has entered into a bilateral treaty for the avoidance of 
double taxation with Switzerland. Non‑Resident Holders 
should be aware that the procedures for claiming treaty 
refunds (and the time frame required for obtaining a 
refund) may differ from country to country. Non‑Resident 
Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding 
receipt, ownership, purchase, sale or other dispositions 
of shares or ADRs, and the procedures for claiming a 
refund of the Withholding Tax.

A Non‑Resident Holder of shares or ADRs will not be lia-
ble for any Swiss taxes other than the Withholding Tax 
described above and, if the transfer occurs through or with 
a Swiss bank or other Swiss securities dealer, the Stamp 
Duty described below. If, however, the shares or ADRs of 
Non‑Resident Holders can be attributed to a permanent 
establishment or a fixed place of business maintained by 
such person within Switzerland during the relevant tax 
year, the shares or ADRs may be subject to Swiss income 
taxes in respect of income and gains realized on the shares 
or ADRs, and such person may qualify for a full refund of 
the Withholding Tax based on Swiss tax law.
Residents of the US. A Non‑Resident Holder who is a 
resident of the US for purposes of the Treaty is eligible 
for a reduced rate of tax on dividends equal to 15% of 
the dividend, provided that such holder (i) qualifies for 
benefits under the Treaty; (ii) is not a company (or, if it is 
a company, such company directly holds less than 10% 
of our voting stock); and (iii) does not conduct business 
through a permanent establishment or fixed base in Swit-
zerland to which the shares or ADRs are attributable. 
Such an eligible holder must apply for a refund of the 
amount of the Withholding Tax in excess of the 15% 
Treaty rate. A Non‑Resident Holder who is a resident of 
the US for purposes of the Treaty is eligible for a reduced 
rate of tax on dividends equal to 5% of the dividend, pro-
vided that such holder (i) is a company; (ii) qualifies for 
benefits under the Treaty; (iii) holds directly at least 10% 
of our voting stock; and (iv) does not conduct business 
through a permanent establishment or fixed place of 
business in Switzerland to which the shares or ADRs are 
attributable. Such an eligible holder must apply for a 
refund of the amount of the Withholding Tax in excess 
of the 5% Treaty rate. Claims for refunds must be filed 
on Swiss Tax Form 82 (82C for corporations; 82I for indi-
viduals; 82E for other entities), which may be obtained 
from any Swiss Consulate General in the US or from the 
Federal Tax Administration of Switzerland at the address 
below, together with an instruction form. Four copies of 
the form must be duly completed, signed before a notary 
public of the US, and sent to the Federal Tax Adminis-
tration of Switzerland, Eigerstrasse 65, CH‑3003 Bern, 
Switzerland. The form must be accompanied by suitable 
evidence of deduction of Swiss tax withheld at source, 
such as certificates of deduction, signed bank vouchers 
or credit slips. The form may be filed on or after July 1 or 
January 1 following the date the dividend was payable, 
but no later than December 31 of the third year following 
the calendar year in which the dividend became payable. 
For US resident holders of ADRs, JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A., as depositary, will comply with these Swiss proce-
dures on behalf of the holders, and will remit the net 
amount to the holders.

Stamp Duty upon transfer of securities. The sale of 
shares, whether by Swiss residents or Non‑Resident 
Holders, may be subject to federal securities transfer 
Stamp Duty of 0.15%, calculated on the sale proceeds, 
if the sale occurs through or with a Swiss bank or other 
Swiss securities dealer, as defined in the Swiss Federal 
Stamp Duty Act. The Stamp Duty has to be paid by the 
securities dealer and may be charged to the parties in a 
taxable transaction who are not securities dealers. Stamp 
Duty may also be due if a sale of shares occurs with or 
through a non‑Swiss bank or securities dealer, provided 
that (i) such bank or dealer is a member of the SIX, and 
(ii) the sale takes place on the SIX. In addition to this Stamp 
Duty, the sale of shares by or through a member of the 
SIX may be subject to a minor stock exchange levy.
US federal income taxation
The following is a general discussion of the material US 
federal income tax consequences of the ownership and 
disposition of our shares or ADRs that may be relevant 
to you if you are a US Holder (as defined below). Because 
this discussion does not consider any specific circum-
stances of any particular holder of our shares or ADRs, 
persons who are subject to US taxation are strongly 
urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the overall 
US federal, state and local tax consequences, as well as 
to the overall Swiss and other foreign tax consequences, 
of the ownership and disposition of our shares or ADRs. 
In particular, additional or different rules may apply to US 
expatriates; banks and other financial institutions; regu-
lated investment companies; traders in securities who 
elect to apply a mark‑to‑market method of accounting; 
dealers in securities or currencies; tax‑exempt entities; 
insurance companies; broker‑dealers; investors liable for 
alternative minimum tax; investors that hold shares or 
ADRs as part of a straddle, hedging or conversion trans-
action; holders whose functional currency is not the US 
dollar; partnerships or other pass-through entities; per-
sons who acquired our shares pursuant to the exercise 
of employee stock options or otherwise as compensa-
tion; and persons who hold, directly, indirectly or by attri-
bution, 10% or more of our outstanding shares. This dis-
cussion generally applies only to US Holders who hold 
the shares or ADRs as a capital asset (generally, for 
investment purposes), and whose functional currency is 
the US dollar. Investors are urged to consult their own 
tax advisors concerning whether they are eligible for 
benefits under the Treaty.
For purposes of this discussion, a US Holder is a ben-
eficial owner of our shares or ADRs who is (i) an individ-
ual who is a citizen or resident of the US for US federal 
income tax purposes; (ii) a corporation (or other entity 
taxable as a corporation for US federal income tax pur-
poses) created or organized in or under the laws of the 
US or a state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an 
estate the income of which is subject to US federal 
income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust 
(i) subject to the primary supervision of a US court and 
the control of one or more US persons, or (ii) that has a 
valid election in place to be treated as a US person. If a 
partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for 
US federal income tax purposes) holds shares or ADRs, 
the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon 
the status of the partner and the activities of the part-
nership. Partners in a partnership that holds shares or 
ADRs are urged to consult their own tax advisor regard-
ing the specific tax consequences of owning and dis-
posing of such shares or ADRs by the partnership.
For US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder of 
ADRs generally will be treated as the beneficial owner 
of our shares represented by the ADRs. However, see 
the discussion below under “Dividends” regarding cer-
tain statements made by the US Treasury concerning 
depositary arrangements.
This discussion assumes that each obligation in the 
Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be 
performed in accordance with its terms.
Dividends. US Holders will be required to include in gross 
income, as an item of ordinary income, the full amount 
(without reduction for any Withholding Tax) of the divi-
dend paid with respect to our shares or ADRs at the time 
that such dividend is received by the US Holder, in the 
case of shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADRs. 
For this purpose, a “dividend” will include any distribu-
tion paid by us with respect to our shares or ADRs (other 
than certain pro rata distributions of our capital stock) 
paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and prof-
its, as determined under US federal income tax princi-
ples. To the extent the amount of a distribution by us 
exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and prof-
its, such excess will first be treated as a tax‑free return 
of capital to the extent of a US Holder’s tax basis in the 
shares or ADRs (with a corresponding reduction in such 
tax basis), and thereafter will be treated as capital gain, 
which will be long‑term capital gain if the US Holder held 
our shares or ADRs for more than one year. Under the 
Code, dividend payments by us on the shares or ADRs 
are not eligible for the dividends received deduction gen-
erally allowed to corporate shareholders.
Dividend income in respect of our shares or ADRs 
will constitute income from sources outside the US for 
US foreign tax credit purposes. Subject to the limitations 
and conditions provided in the Code, US Holders gener-
ally may claim as a credit against their US federal income 
tax liability, any Withholding Tax withheld from a dividend. 
The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. 
Each US Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor 
concerning whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax 
credit will be available with respect to dividends received 
from us. Alternatively, a US Holder may claim the With-
holding Tax as a deduction for the taxable year within 
which the Withholding Tax is paid or accrued, provided 
a deduction is claimed for all of the foreign income taxes 
the US Holder pays or accrues in the particular year. A 
deduction does not reduce US tax on a dollar‑for‑dollar 
basis like a tax credit. The deduction, however, is not 
subject to the limitations applicable to foreign tax cred-
its, but may be subject to other limitations, and each US 
Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor.
The US Treasury has expressed concern that parties 
to whom ADRs are released may be taking actions incon-
sistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits for US 
Holders of ADRs. Accordingly, the summary above of the 
creditability of the Withholding Tax could be affected by 
future actions that may be taken by the US Treasury.

Item 10.  Additional Information
﻿
145
In general, a US Holder will be required to determine 
the amount of any dividend paid in Swiss francs, including 
the amount of any Withholding Tax imposed thereon, by 
translating the Swiss francs into US dollars at the spot rate 
on the date the dividend is actually or constructively 
received by a US Holder, in the case of shares, or by the 
depositary, in the case of ADRs, regardless of whether the 
Swiss francs are in fact converted into US dollars. If a US 
Holder converts the Swiss francs so received into US dol-
lars on the date of receipt, the US Holder generally should 
not recognize foreign currency gain or loss on such con-
version. If a US Holder does not convert the Swiss francs 
so received into US dollars on the date of receipt, the US 
Holder will have a tax basis in the Swiss francs equal to 
the US dollar value on such date. Any foreign currency gain 
or loss that a US Holder recognizes on a subsequent con-
version or other disposition of the Swiss francs generally 
will be treated as US source ordinary income or loss.
For a non‑corporate US Holder, the US dollar amount 
of any dividends paid that constitute qualified dividend 
income generally will be taxable at a maximum rate of 
15% (or 20% in the case of taxpayers with annual income 
that exceeds certain thresholds), provided that the US 
Holder meets certain holding period and other require-
ments. In addition, the dividends could be subject to a 
3.8% net investment income tax. This tax is applied 
against the lesser of the US Holder’s net investment 
income or the amount by which modified adjusted gross 
income exceeds a statutory threshold amount based on 
filing status. We currently believe that dividends paid with 
respect to our shares and ADRs will constitute qualified 
dividend income for US federal income tax purposes, 
provided that the US Holder meets certain holding period 
and other requirements. US Holders of shares or ADRs 
are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the 
availability to them of the reduced dividend rate in light 
of their own particular situation and the computations of 
their foreign tax credit limitation with respect to any qual-
ified dividends paid to them, as applicable.
Sale or other taxable disposition. Upon a sale or other 
taxable disposition of shares or ADRs, US Holders gen-
erally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount 
equal to the difference between the US dollar value of 
the amount realized on the disposition and the US Hold-
er’s tax basis (determined in US dollars) in the shares or 
ADRs. This capital gain or loss generally will be US 
source gain or loss and will be treated as long‑term cap-
ital gain or loss if the holding period in the shares or ADRs 
exceeds one year. In the case of a non‑corporate US 
Holder, any long-term capital gain generally will be sub-
ject to US federal income tax at preferential rates, with 
a maximum rate of 15% (or 20% in the case of taxpayers 
with annual income that exceeds certain thresholds). In 
addition, the gains could be subject to a 3.8% investment 
income tax. This tax is applied against the lesser of the 
US Holder’s net investment income or the amount by 
which modified adjusted gross income exceeds a stat-
utory threshold amount based on filing status. The 
deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant lim-
itations under the Code. Deposits or withdrawals of our 
shares by US Holders in exchanges for ADRs will not 
result in the realization of gain or loss for US federal 
income tax purposes.
US information reporting and backup withholding. Divi-
dend payments with respect to shares or ADRs and pro-
ceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of 
shares or ADRs received in the United States or through 
US‑related financial intermediaries may be subject to 
information reporting to the US Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) and possible US backup withholding. Certain 
exempt recipients (such as corporations) are not subject 
to these information reporting and backup withholding 
requirements. Backup withholding will not apply to a US 
Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification 
number and makes any other required certification or 
who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Any 
US Holders required to establish their exempt status 
generally must provide a properly executed IRS Form W‑9 
(Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certi-
fication). Backup withholding is not an additional tax. 
Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be cred-
ited against a US Holder’s US federal income tax liabil-
ity, and a US Holder may obtain a refund of any excess 
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by 
timely filing the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS 
and furnishing any required information.

Fees payable by the depositary to the 
issuer 
Pursuant to a letter agreement effective as of May 11, 
2017, as amended from time to time (“the Agreement”), 
JPMorgan, as our ADS depositary, has agreed to make 
an annual contribution payment to Novartis at the end of 
each 12-month period beginning on the effective date of 
the Agreement and on each subsequent anniversary of 
the effective date of the Agreement (each such 12-month 
period is a “Contract Year”). Beginning in the sixth Con-
tract Year, this annual contribution payment will equal: 
(a)(1) the applicable fixed contribution amount reflected 
in the table below, based on the average daily balance 
during such Contract Year of outstanding ADSs backed 
by ordinary shares less (a)(2) the custody costs, fees 
and expenses (including, without limitation, any central 
securities depository fees, charges and expenses) 
incurred during the applicable Contract Year (the items 
in (a)(2) collectively are the “Custody Costs”) plus (b) 70% 
of the gross issuance and cancellation fees collected by 
JPMorgan under the Deposit Agreement during such 
Contract Year minus (c) that portion (if any) of JPMor-
gan’s legal fees, charges and out-of-pocket expenses in 
excess of USD 50 000 for such Contract Year.

The fixed contribution amount payable under (a)(1) in 
respect of a given Contract Year shall be zero if the aver-
age daily balance of outstanding ADSs backed by ordi-
nary shares is less than 30 000 000 during such Con-
tract Year. If the Custody Costs for a Contract Year 
exceed the fixed contribution amount for such Contract 
Year, JPMorgan will reduce the contribution payable to 
us by an amount equal to such deficit.
JPMorgan has further agreed to waive the USD 0.05 
per ADS issuance fees that would normally be owed by 
Novartis in connection with our deposits of shares as 
part of our employee stock ownership and employee par-
ticipation plans. Novartis is responsible for reimbursing 
JPMorgan for all taxes and governmental charges 
required to have been withheld and/or paid, and not so 
withheld and/or paid, arising from such waived fees.

Item 15. Controls and Procedures
Report of Novartis Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Novartis AG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Finan‑
cial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our dis‑
closure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange 
Act Rule 13a‑15(e)) as of the end of the period covered 
by this Annual Report, have concluded that, as of such 
date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effec‑
tive.
The Board of Directors and management of the Com‑
pany are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting. The 
Company’s internal control system was designed to pro‑
vide reasonable assurance to the Company’s manage‑
ment and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation and fair presen‑
tation of its published consolidated financial statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well 
designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even 
those systems determined to be effective may not pre‑
vent or detect misstatements and can provide only rea‑
sonable assurance with respect to financial statement 
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject 
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compli‑
ance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management assessed the effective‑
ness of the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting as of December  31, 2024. In making this 
assessment, it used the criteria established in Internal 
Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tread‑
way Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, 
management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, 
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting 
is effective based on those criteria.
KPMG AG, Switzerland, an independent registered 
public accounting firm, has issued an unqualified opin‑
ion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal con‑
trol over financial reporting, which is included in the Form 
20-F under “Item 18. Financial Statements—Report of 
independent registered public accounting firm.”
See the report of KPMG, an independent registered 
public accounting firm, included in the Form 20-F under 
“Item 18. Financial Statements—Report of independent 
registered public accounting firm.”
There were no changes to our internal control over 
financial reporting that occurred during the period cov‑
ered by this Annual Report that have materially affected, 
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal 
control over financial reporting.

Item 16G.  Corporate Governance
Novartis AG is subject to and compliant with the laws 
and regulations of Switzerland (in particular, Swiss com-
pany and securities laws, SIX Swiss Exchange rules and 
the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Gover-
nance) and the securities laws of the United States, 
including NYSE listing standards, as applicable to for-
eign private issuers of securities. The following summa-
rizes some significant ways in which our corporate gov-
ernance practices differ from those followed by 
domestic listed US companies under the listing stan-
dards of the NYSE:
•	 Novartis AG shareholders do not receive written 
reports directly from Board committees.
•	 External auditors are appointed by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), as 
opposed to being appointed by the Audit and Compli-
ance Committee.
•	 While shareholders cannot vote on all equity compen-
sation plans, they are entitled to hold separate, yearly 
binding votes on Board and Executive Committee com-
pensation.
•	 The Board has set up a separate Risk Committee that 
oversees the risk management system and processes, 
as opposed to delegating this responsibility to the Audit 
and Compliance Committee.
•	 The full Board is responsible for overseeing the 
­performance evaluation of the Board and Executive 
Committee.
•	 The full Board is responsible for setting objectives rel-
evant to the CEO’s compensation and for evaluating 
his performance.

We are committed to compliance with laws and regula-

insider trading policy that governs the purchase, sale, 
and other dispositions of Novartis securities by direc-
tors, management, and employees that is reasonably 
designed to promote compliance with applicable insider 
trading laws, rules and regulations, and listing standards. 
A copy of the policy is included as Exhibit 11.1 to the Form

Item 16K.  Cybersecurity
Risk management and strategy
Protecting the security and integrity of the IT systems 
under our control and safeguarding the privacy of our 
customers, patients and employees is a top priority for 
us at all levels. Cybersecurity and data privacy risks are 
among the core enterprise risks evaluated through our 
annual enterprise risk management assessment.
The Chief Security Officer oversees our cybersecu-
rity risk management program in partnership with our 
Chief Information Officer and other business leaders. 
The program was developed to assess, identify and man-
age risks from cybersecurity threats and respond to 
cybersecurity breaches and cyberattacks, and to pro-
tect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and con-
tinued availability of information owned by, or in the care 
of Novartis. 
Governance
To address cybersecurity threats and prevent IT system 
interruptions, the Information Security & Compliance 
(ISC) team, which is headed by our Chief Security Offi-
cer, has implemented enterprise-wide policies, pro-
cesses and practices. Our Chief Security Officer reports 
to our Chief Information Officer, and is a subject matter 
expert on information security, privacy, information tech-
nology strategy and management with over 20 years of 
relevant experience across a number of industries, 
including pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, financial 
services and consulting. Our Chief Information Officer 
has 25 years of experience as an IT professional, includ-
ing 15 years with Novartis, and is responsible for our tech-
nology strategy, delivery and operations globally. Our 
ISC team assesses our systems against our policies and 
processes, reviews gaps, and prioritizes remediation. 
Key performance indicators are reported to the Execu-
tive Committee of Novartis. The Executive Committee is 
responsible for oversight of the Company’s cybersecu-
rity strategy.
We seek to follow industry best practices, such as 
the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO 27001 to 
manage information security. Novartis has risk-based 
services continuity and systems recovery plans in place 
for key business processes, which are tested periodi-
cally. We also conduct ongoing internal vulnerability anal-
yses (including simulated hacking) as well as external 
testing via third parties to ensure the effectiveness of 
our cybersecurity controls. We require employees to 
report IT security incidents to a Cyber Security Opera-
tions Center (CSOC) that operates 24 hours a day, 7 days 
a week. CSOC is a function within ISC that is responsi-
ble for investigating all security incidents and alerts 
including determining the threat type, incident scope and 
incident severity. Where appropriate, major incidents are 
escalated to our Chief Executive Officer, who may then 
inform our Board of the incident pursuant to our internal 
procedures. Novartis has not experienced any cyberse-
curity threats, including as a result of cybersecurity inci-
dents, that have materially affected or are reasonably 
likely to materially affect Novartis, including its business 
strategy, results of operations or financial condition. See 
“Item 3. Key Information—Item 3.D. Risk factors—Oper-
ational risks—Cybersecurity and data protection” for 
information on risks to Novartis from cybersecurity 
threats.
As part of its enterprise risk management oversight, 
the Risk Committee of our Board is responsible for 
ensuring that the Company has implemented an appro-
priate and effective risk management system and pro-
cess, including annually reviewing updates on cyberse-
curity. The Risk Committee receives updates on 
cybersecurity risks, which address a wide range of top-
ics, including recent developments, security incidents, 
evolving standards, vulnerability assessments, third-
party and independent reviews, the threat environment, 
technological trends and information security consider-
ations arising with respect to the peers and vendors of 
Novartis. At least once each year, the Risk Committee 
discusses the Company’s approach to cybersecurity risk 
management with the Chief Security Officer.

Notes to the Novartis consolidated financial 
statements
1. Accounting policies
Novartis is a multinational group of companies (Novartis 
or Company) specializing in the research, development, 
manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of 
innovative pharmaceutical medicines. The Company is 
headquartered in Basel, Switzerland.
The consolidated financial statements of the Com-
pany are prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS®) Accounting Stan-
dards as issued by the International Accounting Stan-
dards Board. They are prepared in accordance with the 
historical cost convention, except for items that are 
required to be accounted for at fair value.
The Company’s financial year-end is December 31, 
which is also the annual closing date of the individual 
entities’ financial statements incorporated into the Com-
pany’s consolidated ­financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements requires 
management to make certain estimates and assump-
tions, either at the balance sheet date or during the year, 
which affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, 
assets,  and liabilities, including the distribution liability 
and the non-cash, non-taxable gain recognized in con-
nection with the distribution of Sandoz Group AG to 
Novartis AG shareholders, and contingent amounts.
Estimates are based on historical experience and 
other assumptions that are considered reasonable under 
the given circumstances and are regularly monitored. 
Actual outcomes and results could differ from those esti-
mates and assumptions. Revisions to estimates are rec-
ognized in the period in which the estimate is revised.
At the Novartis AG Extraordinary General Meeting, 
held on September 15, 2023, our shareholders approved 
the spin-off of the Sandoz business. Following the share- 
holder approval, IFRS Accounting Standards required 
the Sandoz Division and selected portions of corporate 
activities attributable to Sandoz’s business, as well as 
certain expenses related to the spin-off (the “Sandoz 
business”) to be reported as discontinued operations in 
the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the 
Sandoz business has been presented as discontinued 
operations in the consolidated financial statements. This 
required the year ended December 31, 2023 consoli-
dated income statement, consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income and consolidated statement of 
cash flows to present separately continuing operations 
from discontinued operations, with comparative amounts 
in 2022 restated on a consistent basis. For further infor-
mation and disclosures refer to the section “—Distribu-
tion of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders” 
in this Note 1, and in Note 2, and Note 29. 
Listed below are the material accounting policies of sig-
nificance to Novartis or, in cases where IFRS Account-
ing Standards provide alternatives, the option adopted 
by Novartis.
Scope of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include all enti-
ties, including structured entities, over which Novartis 
AG, Basel, Switzerland, directly or indirectly has control 
(generally as a result of owning more than 50% of the 
entity’s voting interest). Consolidated entities are also 
referred to as “subsidiaries.” 
In cases where Novartis does not fully own a subsid-
iary, it has elected to value any remaining outstanding 
non-controlling interest at the time of acquiring control 
of the subsidiary at its proportionate share of the fair 
value of the net identified assets.
Investments in associated companies (generally 
defined as investments in entities in which Novartis holds 
between 20% and 50% of voting shares or over which it 
otherwise has significant influence) and joint ventures 
are accounted for using the equity method, except for 
selected venture fund investments for which the Com-
pany has elected to apply the method of fair value through 
the consolidated income statement.
Foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements of Novartis are 
presented in US dollars (USD). The functional currency 
of a subsidiary is generally the local currency of that 
entity. The functional currency used for the reporting of 
certain Swiss and foreign finance entities is USD instead 
of their respective local currencies. This reflects the fact 
that the cash flows and transactions of these entities are 
primarily denominated in this currency.
For subsidiaries using a functional currency other 
than USD, the subsidiary’s results, financial position and 
cash flows are translated into USD using the following 
exchange rates:
•	 Income, expense and cash flows for each month using 
the average exchange rate, with the US dollar values 
for each month being aggregated during the year
•	 Balance sheet using year-end exchange rates
•	 Resulting exchange rate differences are recognized in 
other comprehensive income
Distribution of Sandoz Group AG to 
Novartis AG shareholders 
At the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of Novartis 
AG shareholders, held on September 15, 2023, the 
Novartis AG shareholders approved a special distribu-
tion by way of a dividend in kind to effect the spin-off of 
Sandoz Group AG.
The September 15, 2023, shareholder approval for 
the spin-off required the Sandoz Division and selected

portions of corporate activities attributable to Sandoz’s 
business, as well as certain expenses related to the spin-
off (the “Sandoz business”) to be reported as discontin-
ued operations. 
The shareholder approval on September 15, 2023, 
for the spin-off the Sandoz business, required the rec-
ognition of a distribution liability at the fair value of the 
Sandoz business. Novartis policy is to measure the dis-
tribution liability at the fair value of the Sandoz business 
net assets taken as a whole. The distribution liability was 
recognized through a reduction in retained earnings. It 
was required to be adjusted at each balance sheet date 
for changes in its estimated fair value, up to the date of 
the distribution to shareholders through retained earn-
ings. Any resulting impairment of the business assets to 
be distributed would have been recognized in the con-
solidated income statements in “Other expense” of dis-
continued operations, at the date of initial recognition of 
the distribution liability or at subsequent dates resulting 
from changes of the distribution liability valuation. 
At the October 4, 2023, distribution settlement date, 
the resulting gain, which is measured as the excess 
amount of the distribution liability over the then-carrying 
value of the net assets of the business distributed, was 
recognized on the line “Gain on distribution of Sandoz 
Group AG to Novartis AG shareholders” within the 
income statement of discontinued operations.
The recognition of the distribution liability required 
the use of valuation techniques for the purposes of 
impairment testing of the Sandoz business’ assets to be 
distributed and for the measurement of the fair value of 
the distribution liability. These valuations required the 
use of management assumptions and estimates related 
to the Sandoz business’ future cash flows, market mul-
tiples, and the opening share price of Sandoz Group AG 
on the first day of trading its shares on the SIX Swiss 
Exchange, to estimate day one market value, and con-
trol premiums to apply in estimating the Sandoz business 
fair value. These fair value measurements are classified 
as “Level 3” in the fair value hierarchy. The section “—
Goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill” in 
this Note 1 provides additional information on key assump-
tions that are highly sensitive in the estimation of fair val-
ues using valuation techniques. 
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
Distribution (spin-off) of the Sandoz business to Novartis 
AG shareholders by way of a dividend in kind, and that 
would otherwise have been avoided, were accounted for 
as a deduction from equity (within retained earnings). 
Prior to the recognition of the distribution liability, these 
costs were recorded as prepaid expenses in the consol-
idated balance sheet.
For additional disclosures, refer to  the section “— 
Distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG share-
holders” in Note 2 and Note 29. 
Acquisition of assets and businesses
Assets separately acquired are recorded at cost, which 
includes the purchase price and any directly attributable 
costs for bringing the asset into the condition to operate 
as intended. Expected costs for obligations to disman-
tle and remove property, plant and equipment and restore 
the site when it is no longer used are included in their 
cost.
Acquired businesses are accounted for by applying 
the acquisition method, unless the optional concentra-
tion test is applied. The optional concentration test 
allows for an election on a transaction-by-transaction 
basis to account for the acquired business as an asset 
separately acquired when substantially all of the fair 
value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a 
single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable 
assets.
The acquisition method requires that the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their 
respective fair values on the date the Company obtains 
control. The excess of the fair value of the total purchase 
consideration transferred over the fair value of the 
acquired assets and assumed liabilities is recognized as 
goodwill. The valuations are based on information avail-
able at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are 
expensed as incurred.
The application of the acquisition method requires 
certain estimates and assumptions to be made, espe-
cially concerning the fair values of the acquired intangi-
ble assets, inventories, property, plant and equipment 
and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, and 
the useful lives of the intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment. Estimates of fair value require the 
use of valuation techniques. These valuations require the 
use of management assumptions and estimates, includ-
ing the value of comparable assets in the market, amount 
and timing of future cash flows, outcomes and costs of 
research and development activities, probability of 
obtaining regulatory approval, long-term sales forecasts, 
actions of competitors, discount rates and terminal 
growth rates. The section “—Goodwill and intangible 
assets other than goodwill” in this Note 1 provides addi-
tional information on key assumptions that are highly sen-
sitive in the estimation of fair values using valuation tech-
niques.
Goodwill and intangible assets other 
than goodwill
Goodwill arises on applying the acquisition method on 
the acquisition of a business and is the excess of the fair 
value of the consideration transferred to acquire the 
business over the underlying fair value of the net identi-
fied assets acquired. Goodwill is allocated to groups of 
cash-generating units (CGUs) that is expected to bene-
fit from the synergies of the combination, which are usu-
ally represented by the operating segment. Goodwill is 
tested for impairment at the level of this group of CGUs 
annually, or when facts and circumstances warrant, and 
any impairment charges are recorded under “Other 
expense” in the consolidated income statement.
Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are 
initially recorded at cost. Intangible assets that have been 
acquired through a business combination are initially 
recorded at fair value using the acquisition method of 
accounting.
Intangible assets available for use with a definitive 
useful life (which includes the categories Currently mar-
keted products and Other intangible assets) are

amortized on a straight-line basis and evaluated for 
potential impairment whenever facts and circumstances 
indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.
Acquired research and development intangible 
assets that have not yet obtained marketing approval are 
recognized as in-process research and development 
(IPR&D). IPR&D is not amortized as it is not yet available 
for use. It is evaluated for potential impairment on an 
annual basis or when facts and circumstances warrant. 
Once a project included in IPR&D has received market-
ing approval from a regulatory authority, it is transferred 
to the “Currently marketed products” category of intan-
gible assets.
An asset, a CGU or a grouping of CGUs is considered 
impaired when its balance sheet carrying amount 
exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, which is 
defined as the higher of its fair value less costs of dis-
posal and its value in use. Usually, Novartis applies the 
fair value less costs of disposal method for its impair-
ment assessment. In most cases, no directly observable 
market inputs are available to measure the fair value less 
costs of disposal. An estimate is therefore derived indi-
rectly and is based on net present value techniques uti-
lizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates. In the lim-
ited cases where the value-in-use method would be 
applied, net present value techniques would be applied 
using pre-tax cash flows and discount rates.
Fair value less costs of disposal reflects estimates of 
assumptions that market participants would be expected 
to use when pricing the asset or CGU, and for this pur-
pose, management considers the range of economic 
­conditions that are expected to exist over the remaining 
useful life of the asset. These valuations are classified 
as “Level 3” in the fair value hierarchy.
The estimates used in calculating the net present val-
ues are highly sensitive and depend on assumptions spe-
cific to the nature of the Company’s activities with regard 
to:
•	 Amount and timing of projected future cash flows
•	 Sales forecasts 
•	 Actions of competitors (launch of competing products, 
marketing initiatives, etc.)
•	 Sales erosion rates after the end of a patent, loss of 
exclusivity or other intellectual property rights protec-
tion, and timing of the entry of generic competition
•	 Outcome of research and development activities (com-
pound efficacy, results of ­clinical trials, etc.)
•	 Amount and timing of projected costs to develop IPR&D 
into ­commercially viable products
•	 Profit margins
•	 Probability of obtaining regulatory approval
•	 Future tax rate
•	 Appropriate terminal growth/decline rate
•	 Appropriate discount rate
Generally, for intangible assets with a definite useful life, 
Novartis uses cash flow projections for the whole useful 
life of these assets. For goodwill, Novartis generally uti-
lizes cash flow projections for a three-year period based 
on management forecasts, with a terminal value based 
on cash flow projections usually in line with inflation rates 
for later periods. 
Probability-weighted scenarios are ­typically used.
Discount rates used consider the Company’s esti-
mated weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for spe-
cific asset, country and currency risks associated with 
cash flow projections, to approximate the discount rate 
that market participants would use to value the asset.
Due to the above factors, actual cash flows and val-
ues could vary significantly from forecasted future cash 
flows and related values derived using discounting tech-
niques. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid invest-
ments with original maturities of three months or less, 
which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. 
Bank overdrafts are presented within current financial 
debts on the consolidated balance sheet.
Marketable securities and non-
current financial assets 
Marketable securities are financial assets held for short-
term purposes that are principally traded in liquid mar-
kets and are classified within current assets on the con-
solidated balance sheet. The financial impacts related 
to these financial assets are recorded in “Other financial 
income and expense” in the consolidated income state-
ment. Non-current financial assets held for long-term 
strategic purposes are classified within non-current 
assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The financial 
impacts related to these financial assets are recorded 
in “Other income” and “Other expense” in the consoli-
dated income statement.
Marketable securities and non-current financial 
assets are initially recorded at fair value on their trade 
date, which is different from the settlement date when 
the transaction is ultimately effected. Quoted securities 
are remeasured at each reporting date to fair value based 
on current market prices. If the market for a financial 
asset is not active or no market is available, fair values 
are established using valuation techniques. The major-
ity of non-quoted investments are initially valued at fair 
value through the purchase price established between 
a willing buyer and seller. Non-quoted investments are 
subsequently adjusted based on values derived from dis-
counted cash flow analysis or other pricing models. 
These investment values are classified as “Level 3” in 
the fair value hierarchy.
The Company classifies and accounts for its market-
able securities and non-current financial assets in the 
following categories:
•	 Debt securities are valued at fair value through other 
comprehensive income with subsequent recycling into 
the consolidated income statement, as they meet both 
the “solely payment of principal and interest” and the 
business model criteria. Unrealized gains and losses, 
except exchange gains and losses, are recorded as a 
fair value adjustment in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. They are recognized in the 
consolidated income statement when the debt instru-
ment is sold, at which time the gain/loss is transferred 
to “Other financial income and expense.” Exchange

F-9
gains and losses related to debt instruments are imme-
diately recognized in the consolidated income state-
ment in “Other financial income and expense.”
•	 Fund investments and equity securities of the Novartis 
Venture Fund are valued at fair value through profit and 
loss (FVPL). Unrealized gains and losses, including 
exchange gains and losses, are recognized in the con-
solidated income statement in “Other income” for gains 
and “Other expense” for losses.
•	 Equity securities held as strategic investments, typi-
cally held outside of the Novartis Venture Fund, are 
generally designated at the date of acquisition as finan-
cial assets valued at fair value through other compre-
hensive income with no subsequent recycling through 
profit and loss. Unrealized gains and losses, including 
exchange gains and losses, are recorded as a fair value 
adjustment in the consolidated statement of compre-
hensive income. They are reclassified to retained earn-
ings when the equity security is sold. If these equity 
securities are not designated at the date of acquisition 
as financial assets valued at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, they are valued at FVPL, as 
described above.
•	 Other non-current financial assets, such as loans and 
long-term receivables from customers, advances and 
other deposits, are valued at amortized cost, which 
reflects the time value of money less any allowances 
for expected credit losses.
The Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the 
expected credit losses associated with its debt securi-
ties valued at fair value through other comprehensive 
income. Impairments on debt securities are recorded in 
“Other financial income and expense.”
For other financial assets valued at amortized cost, 
impairments, which are based on their expected credit 
losses, and exchange rate losses are included in “Other 
expense” in the consolidated income statement. 
Exchange rate gains and interest income, using the effec-
tive interest rate method, are included in “Other income” 
or “Other financial income” in the consolidated income 
statement, depending on the nature of the item.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized 
in the balance sheet at fair value and are remeasured to 
their current fair value at the end of each subsequent 
reporting period. The valuation of a forward exchange 
rate contract is based on the discounted cash flow 
model, using interest rate curves and forward rates at 
the reporting date as observable inputs.
Options are valued based on a modified Black-
Scholes model using volatility and exercise prices as 
major observable inputs.
The Company enters into certain derivative financial 
instruments for the purpose of hedging to reduce vola-
tility in the Company’s performance due to exposure to 
various business-related risks. The risk mitigation is 
obtained because the derivative’s value or cash flows 
are expected, wholly or partly, to offset changes in the 
value or cash flows of the recognized assets or liabilities. 
The overall strategy aims to mitigate the currency and 
interest rate risk of positions that are contractually 
agreed, and to partially mitigate the exposure risk of 
selected anticipated transactions.
Certain derivative financial instruments meet the cri-
teria for hedge accounting treatment. A prerequisite for 
obtaining this accounting-hedge relationship is exten-
sive documentation on inception and proving on a regu-
lar basis that the economic hedge is effective for account-
ing purposes. Other derivative financial instruments do 
not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting or 
are not designated in a hedge relationship. Changes in 
the fair value of these derivative instruments are recog-
nized immediately in “Other financial income and 
expense” in the consolidated income statement.
In addition, the Company has designated certain 
long-term debt components as hedges of the translation 
risk arising on certain net investments in foreign opera-
tions. On consolidation, foreign currency differences 
arising on long-term debt designated as net investment 
hedges of a foreign operation are recognized in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in currency 
translation effects, to the extent that the hedge is effec-
tive. The foreign currency differences arising from hedge 
ineffectiveness are recognized in the income statement 
in “Other financial income and expense.”
When a hedged net investment is disposed of, the 
proportionate portion of the cumulative amount recog-
nized in equity in relation to the hedged net investment 
is transferred to the consolidated income statement as 
an adjustment to the gain or loss on disposal.
Inventories
Inventory is valued at the lower of acquisition or produc-
tion cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis and net 
realizable value. This value is used for the “Cost of goods 
sold” in the consolidated income statement. Unsaleable 
inventory is fully written off in the consolidated income 
statement under “Cost of goods sold.”
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognized at their invoiced 
amounts, including any related sales taxes less adjust-
ments for estimated revenue deductions such as rebates, 
chargebacks and cash discounts.
Provisions for doubtful trade receivables are estab-
lished using a forward-looking expected credit loss 
model (ECL). Charges for doubtful trade receivables are 
recorded as marketing and selling costs recognized in 
the consolidated income statement within “Selling, gen-
eral and administration” expenses.

 Legal and environmental liabilities
Novartis and its subsidiaries are subject to contingen-
cies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as 
patent litigation, environmental remediation liabilities and 
other product-related and commercial litigation, and gov-
ernmental investigations and proceedings. ­A provision 
is recorded when there is a probable outflow of resources 
for which a reliable estimate can be made of the outcome 
of the legal or other disputes against the subsidiary.
Contingent consideration
In the acquisition or divestment of a business, it is nec-
essary to recognize contingent future amounts due to 
previous owners, representing contractually defined 
potential amounts as a liability or an asset. Usually for 
Novartis, these are linked to milestone or royalty pay-
ments related to certain assets and are recognized as a 
financial liability or financial asset at fair value, which is 
then remeasured at each subsequent reporting date. 
These estimations typically depend on factors such as 
technical milestones or ­market performance, and are 
adjusted for the probability of their likelihood of payment, 
and are appropriately discounted to reflect the impact 
of time.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration 
liabilities in subsequent periods are recognized in the 
consolidated income statement in “Cost of goods sold” 
for currently marketed products and in “Research and 
development” for IPR&D. Changes in contingent consid-
eration assets are recognized in “Other income” or 
“Other expense,” depending on their nature. 
The effect of unwinding the discount over time is rec-
ognized for contingent consideration liabilities in “Inter-
est expense” and for contingent consideration assets as 
interest income recognized in the consolidated income 
statement within “Other financial income and expense.”
Defined benefit pension plans and 
other post-employment benefits
The liability in respect of defined benefit pension plans 
and other post-employment benefits is the defined ben-
efit obligation calculated annually by independent actu-
aries using the projected unit credit method.  The cur-
rent service cost for defined benefit pension plans and 
other post-employment benefit plans is included in the 
personnel expenses of the various functions in which 
employees are employed, and the net interest on the net 
defined benefit liability or asset is recognized as “Other 
expense” or “Other income.” 
Revenue recognition
Revenue on the sale of Novartis products and services, 
which is recorded as net sales to third parties in the line 
“Net sales from continuing operations” in the consoli-
dated income statement, is recognized when a contrac-
tual promise to a customer (performance obligation) has 
been fulfilled by transferring control over the promised 
goods and services to the customer, substantially all of 
which is at the point in time of shipment to, or receipt of, 
the products by the customer or when the services are 
performed. If contracts contain customer acceptance 
provisions, revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction 
of the acceptance criteria. If a contract contains more 
than one performance obligation, the consideration is 
allocated based on the standalone selling price of each 
performance obligation. The amount of revenue recog-
nized is based on the consideration Novartis expects to 
receive in exchange for its goods and services, when it 
is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.
The consideration Novartis receives in exchange for 
its goods or services may be fixed or variable. Variable 
consideration is recognized when it is highly probable 
that a significant reversal will not occur. The most com-
mon elements of variable consideration are listed below.
•	 Rebates and discounts granted to wholesalers, retail-
ers, government agencies (including US Medicaid and 
US Federal Medicare programs), government sup-
ported healthcare systems, private health systems, 
pharmacy benefit managers, managed healthcare 
organizations, purchasing organizations and other 
direct and indirect customers, as well as chargebacks 
are provisioned and recorded as revenue deductions 
at the time the related revenues are recorded, or when 
the incentives are offered. The provision represents 
estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use 
of judgment when estimating the effect of these reve-
nue deductions. These rebates and discounts, applied 
using provision rates, are estimated based on the terms 
and conditions in the individual government agencies, 
states, plans and customer agreements (which may be 
subject to challenge or change in interpretative guid-
ance by government authorities, payers and custom-
ers), historical experience, product sales and growth 
rate, population growth, product pricing including infla-
tion impacts, the mix of contracts and products, the 
level of inventory in the distribution channel, regula-
tions, channels and payers, as appropriate to the indi-
vidual rebate and discount arrangements. These rebate 
provisions are adjusted based on established pro-
cesses and experiences, for example from filing data 
with individual government agencies, states, and plans. 
There is often a time lag between the recording of rev-
enue deductions and the final accounting for them.
•	 Refunds granted to healthcare providers under 
innovative pay-for-performance agreements (i.e. out-
come based arrangements) are provisioned and 
recorded as a revenue deduction at the time the related 
sales are recorded. The provision represents estimates 
of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment 
when estimating the effect of these revenue deduc-
tions. They are calculated on the basis of historical 
experience and clinical data available for the product, 
as well as the specific terms of the individual

F-11
agreements. In cases where historical experience and 
clinical data are not sufficient for a reliable estimation 
of the outcome, revenue recognition is deferred until 
the uncertainty is resolved, until such history is avail-
able or the period when the refund right has expired. 
The provisions for revenue deductions under innovative 
pay-for-performance agreements are adjusted period-
ically based on established processes and actual expe-
rience, including the products actual outcomes 
achieved compared with the anticipated predefined 
targets.
•	 Cash discounts are offered to customers to encourage 
prompt payment and are provisioned and recorded as 
revenue deductions at the time the related sales are 
recorded.
•	 Sales returns provisions are recognized and recorded 
as revenue deductions when there is historical expe-
rience of Novartis agreeing to customer returns and 
Novartis can reasonably estimate expected future 
returns. The provision represents estimates of the 
related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when 
estimating the effect of these revenue deductions. In 
doing so, the estimated rate of return is applied, deter-
mined on the basis of historical experience of customer 
returns and considering any other relevant factors. This 
is applied to the amounts invoiced, also considering 
the amount of returned product to be destroyed ver-
sus product that can be placed back in inventory for 
resale. Where shipments are made on a resale or return 
basis, without sufficient historical experience for esti-
mating sales returns, revenue is only recorded when 
there is evidence of consumption or when the right of 
return has expired. The provisions for sales returns are 
adjusted periodically based on established processes 
and actual experience. 
Net sales to third parties and provisions for revenue 
deductions are adjusted periodically to reflect experi-
ence and to reflect actual amounts as rebates, refunds, 
discounts and returns are processed. There is often a 
time lag between recording of revenue deductions and 
the final accounting for them. The provision represents 
estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of 
judgment when estimating the effect of these revenue 
deductions.
“Other revenue” includes income from profit-sharing 
arrangements with our collaboration partners, and roy-
alty and milestone income from the out-licensing of intel-
lectual property when Novartis retains an interest in the 
intellectual property through a license. Royalty income 
earned from a license is recognized when the underly-
ing sales have occurred. Milestone income is recognized 
at the point in time when it is highly probable that the rel-
evant milestone event criteria are met, and the risk of 
reversal of revenue recognition is remote. “Other reve-
nue” also includes revenue from activities such as man-
ufacturing or other services rendered, to the extent such 
revenue is not recorded under net sales, and is recog-
nized when control transfers to the third party and our 
performance obligations are satisfied. 
Research and development
Internal research and development (R&D) costs are fully 
charged to “Research and development” in the consol-
idated income statement in the period in which they are 
incurred. The Company considers that regulatory and 
other uncertainties inherent in the development of new 
products preclude the capitalization of internal develop-
ment expenses as an intangible asset until marketing 
approval from a regulatory authority is obtained in a 
major market such as the United States, the European 
Union, Switzerland, China or Japan.
Payments made to third parties such as contract 
research and development organizations in compensa-
tion for subcontracted R&D, that are deemed not to 
transfer intellectual property to Novartis are expensed 
as internal R&D expenses in the period in which they are 
incurred. Such payments are only capitalized if they meet 
the criteria for recognition of an internally generated 
intangible asset, usually when marketing approval has 
been received from a regulatory authority in a major mar-
ket.
Payments made to third parties to in-license or 
acquire intellectual property rights, compounds and 
products, including initial upfront and subsequent mile-
stone payments, are capitalized, as are payments for 
other assets, such as technologies to be used in R&D 
activities. If additional payments are made to the origi-
nator company to continue performing R&D activities, an 
evaluation is made as to the nature of the payments. Such 
additional payments will be expensed if they are deemed 
to be compensation for subcontracted R&D services not 
resulting in an additional transfer of intellectual property 
rights to Novartis. Such additional payments will be cap-
italized if they are deemed to be compensation for the 
transfer to Novartis of additional intellectual property 
developed at the risk of the originator company. Subse-
quent internal R&D costs in relation to IPR&D and other 
assets are expensed, since the technical feasibility of 
the internal R&D activity can only be demonstrated by 
the receipt of marketing approval for a related product 
from a regulatory authority in a major market.
Costs for post-approval studies performed to sup-
port the continued registration of a marketed product 
are recognized as marketing expenses. Costs for activ-
ities that are required by regulatory authorities as a con-
dition for obtaining marketing approval in a major market 
are capitalized and recognized as currently marketed 
products.
Inventory produced ahead of regulatory approval is 
fully provisioned, and the charge is included in “Other 
expense” in the consolidated income statement, as its 
ultimate use ­cannot be assured. If this inventory can sub-
sequently be sold, the provision is released to “Other 
income” in the consolidated income statement, either on 
approval by the appropriate regulatory authority or, 
exceptionally in Europe, on recommendation by the 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(CHMP), if approval is virtually certain.

Share-based compensation
Vested Novartis shares and American Depositary 
Receipts (ADRs) that are granted as compensation are 
valued at their market value on the grant date and are 
immediately expensed in the consolidated income state-
ment.
The fair values of unvested restricted shares (RSs), 
restricted share units (RSUs) and performance share 
units (PSUs) in Novartis shares and ADRs granted to 
employees as compensation are recognized as an 
expense over the related vesting period. The expense 
recorded in the consolidated income statement is 
included in the personnel expenses of the various func-
tions in which the employees are employed.
Unvested restricted shares, restricted ADRs and 
RSUs are only conditional on the provision of services 
by the plan participant during the vesting period. They 
are valued at fair value on the grant date. As RSUs do 
not entitle the holder to dividends, the fair value is based 
on the Novartis share price at the grant date adjusted 
for the net present value of the dividends expected to 
be paid during the holding period. The fair value of these 
grants, after making adjustments for assumptions related 
to forfeiture during the vesting period, is expensed on a 
straight-line basis over the respective vesting period.
PSUs are subject to the achievement of certain per-
formance criteria and require plan participants to pro-
vide services during the vesting period. The performance 
criteria are based on Novartis internal performance met-
rics and, for certain plans, also variables that can be 
observed in the market, which for Novartis plans is the 
Novartis total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a spe-
cific peer group of companies over the vesting period. 
The expense is recognized in the consolidated income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, 
and is determined based on a bifurcation into the com-
ponents based on the performance criteria related to 
Novartis internal performance metrics and TSR. The 
number of equity instruments that finally vest is deter-
mined at the vesting date. The following paragraphs pro-
vide an overview of the accounting policies for the deter-
mination of the components of the PSU share-based 
compensation plan expense. 
The portion of the PSUs expense that is subject to 
performance criteria based on Novartis internal perfor-
mance metrics over the vesting period is determined 
based on assumptions concerning the expected perfor-
mance against the internal performance metrics through-
out the vesting period. The assumptions are based on 
the Company’s targets for those performance metrics, 
and the expected forfeitures due to plan participants not 
meeting their service conditions. The assumptions are 
periodically adjusted over the vesting period. For this 
portion of the PSUs expense, any change in estimates 
for past services is recorded immediately as an expense 
or income in the consolidated income statement, and 
amounts for the remaining vesting period are expensed 
on a straight-line basis. As a result, at the end of the vest-
ing period, the expense during the entire vesting period 
represents the amount that will finally vest.
The portion of the PSUs expense that is subject to 
performance criteria based on Novartis TSR relative to 
a specific peer group of companies over the vesting 
period is determined based on the total fair value of the 
grant over the vesting period. IFRS Accounting Stan-
dards require that these variables that can be observed 
in the market are taken into account in determining the 
fair value of the PSUs at the grant date. Novartis deter-
mined the fair value of these PSUs at the date of grant 
using a Monte Carlo simulation model. For this portion 
of the PSUs expense, adjustments to expense recog-
nized in the consolidated income statement are only 
made if a plan participant does not fulfill the service con-
ditions.
Measuring the fair values of PSUs granted that 
include TSR performance criteria requires the use of 
estimates. The Monte Carlo simulation used to determine 
the fair value of the PSUs TSR performance criteria 
requires the probability of factors related to uncertain 
future events; the term of the award; the grant price of 
underlying shares or ADRs; expected volatilities; the 
expected correlation matrix of the underlying equity 
instruments with those of the peer group of companies; 
and the risk-free interest rate as input parameters.
If a plan participant leaves Novartis for reasons other 
than retirement, disability or death, then unvested 
restricted shares, restricted ADRs, RSUs and PSUs are 
forfeited, unless determined otherwise by the provision 
of the plan rules or by the Compensation Committee of 
the Novartis Board of Directors, for example, in connec-
tion with a reorganization or divestment. 
Income taxes
Income taxes comprise current income taxes and 
deferred income taxes and are recognized in the same 
periods as the revenues and expenses to which they 
relate. Income taxes include interest and penalties 
incurred during the period, insofar as they are consid-
ered an income tax. Income taxes related to items rec-
ognized directly to other comprehensive income or to 
equity are recognized together with the corresponding 
item, to which the income tax is attributable, directly in 
other comprehensive income or in equity.
Deferred income taxes are determined using the 
comprehensive liability method and are calculated on 
the temporary differences that arise between the tax 
base of an asset or liability and its carrying value for 
financial reporting purposes, except for those temporary 
differences related to investments in subsidiaries and 
associated companies, where the timing of their rever-
sal can be controlled and it is probable that the differ-
ence will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Since the 
retained earnings of subsidiaries are reinvested, with-
holding or other taxes on eventual distribution of a sub-
sidiary’s retained earnings are only recognized when a 
dividend is declared or has been planned. Furthermore, 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the net tax 
effects of net operating loss carryforwards and tax cred-
its. 
The Company applies the IFRS Accounting Stan-
dards exception to not recognize or disclose information 
about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar 
Two income taxes.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reduced to the extent that it is not probable that

sufficient taxable profits will be available to enable all or 
part of the asset to be recovered. In evaluating our abil-
ity to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction 
from which they arise, we consider all available positive 
and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of 
deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, 
tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.
The estimated amounts for current and deferred tax 
assets or liabilities, including amounts related to any 
uncertain tax positions, are based on applicable tax law 
and regulations in the various tax jurisdictions, in which 
the Company operates, which are subject to interpreta-
tions based on currently known facts and circumstances.  
Tax returns are based on an interpretation of tax laws 
and regulations, and reflect estimates based on these 
judgments and interpretations. The tax returns are sub-
ject to examination by the competent taxing authorities, 
which may result in an assessment being made requir-
ing payments of additional tax, interest or penalties. 
The calculation of income tax assets and liabilities 
involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of 
complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of juris-
dictions across our global operations. As a result, inher-
ent uncertainties exist in the estimates of the tax posi-
tions. Tax liabilities for uncertain tax provisions are 
recognized on the consolidated balance sheets within 
current income tax liabilities.
Impact of new IFRS Accounting 
Standards, amendments and 
interpretations in 2024
No new IFRS Accounting Standards were adopted by 
the Company in 2024, 2023 and 2022. There were no 
new IFRS Accounting Standards amendments or inter-
pretations that became effective in 2024, 2023 and 2022 
that had a material impact on the Company’s consoli-
dated financial statements.
In 2024, the following new IFRS Accounting Stan-
dard, which is not yet effective, was issued by the Inter-
national Accounting Standards Board: 
IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial 
Statements
IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial State-
ments was issued by the International Accounting Stan-
dards Board in April 2024. IFRS 18 will become effective 
on January 1, 2027, and is required to be applied retro-
spectively to comparative periods presented, with early 
adoption permitted. Upon adoption, IFRS 18 replaces 
International Accounting Standards (IAS®) Standards 1 
– Presentation of Financial Statements. 
IFRS 18 sets out new requirements focused on 
improving financial reporting by: 
•	 requiring additional defined structure to the statement 
of profit or loss (i.e. consolidated statement of income), 
to reduce diversity in the reporting, by requiring five 
categories (operating, investing, financing, income 
taxes and discontinued operations) and defined sub-
totals and totals (operating income, income before 
financing, income taxes and net income), 
•	 requiring disclosures in the notes to the financial state-
ments about management-defined performance mea-
sures (i.e. non-IFRS measures), and 
•	 adding new principles for aggregation and disaggre-
gation of information in the primary financial state-
ments and notes.  
IFRS 18 will not impact the recognition or measurement 
of items in the financial statements, but it might change 
what an entity reports as its “operating profit or loss”, 
due to the classification of certain income and expense 
items between the five categories of the consolidated 
income statement. It might also change what an entity 
reports as operating activities, investing activities and 
financing activities within the statement of cash flows, 
due to the change in classification of certain cash flow 
items between these three categories of the cash flows 
statement. Novartis is currently assessing the impact of 
adopting IFRS 18.
Based on the Company’s assessment, there were no 
other IFRS Accounting Standards, amendments or inter-
pretations not yet effective in 2024, 2023 or 2022 that 
would have been expected to have a material impact on 
the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

 2. Significant acquisitions of businesses and spin-off 
of Sandoz business
The Company applied the acquisition method of account-
ing for businesses acquired, and did not elect to apply 
the optional concentration test to account for acquired 
business as an asset separately acquired.
Significant acquisitions of 
businesses in 2024
Acquisition of Kate Therapeutics Inc.
On October 31, 2024, Novartis acquired Kate Therapeu-
tics Inc. (Kate Therapeutics), a US based, preclini-
cal-stage biotechnology company focused on develop-
ing adeno-associated viruses (AAV) based gene 
therapies to treat genetically defined muscle and heart 
diseases.
The purchase price consisted of a cash payment of 
USD 427 million (including purchase price adjustments 
of USD 2 million) and potential additional milestones of 
up to USD 700 million, which Kate Therapeutics share-
holders are eligible to receive upon the achievement of 
specified development milestones.
The fair value of the total purchase consideration was 
USD 518 million, consisting of a cash payment of USD 
427 million and the fair value of contingent consideration 
of USD 91 million. The purchase price allocation resulted 
in net identifiable assets of USD 234 million, consisting 
primarily of IPR&D intangible assets of USD 135 million, 
other intangible assets (scientific infrastructure) of USD 
135 million, cash and cash equivalents of USD 6 million, 
net deferred tax liabilities of USD 41 million and other net 
liabilities of USD 1 million. Goodwill amounted to USD 
284 million.
The results of operations since the date of acquisi-
tion were not material.
Acquisition of Mariana Oncology Inc.
On May 3, 2024, Novartis acquired Mariana Oncology 
Inc. (Mariana Oncology), a US based, preclinical-stage 
biotechnology company focused on developing novel 
radioligand therapies (RLTs) with a portfolio of RLT pro-
grams across a range of solid tumor indications. 
The purchase price consisted of a cash payment of 
USD 1.04 billion and potential additional milestones of 
up to USD 750 million, which Mariana Oncology share-
holders are eligible to receive upon the achievement of 
speciﬁed milestones. 
The fair value of the total purchase consideration was 
USD 1.28 billion, consisting of a cash payment of USD 
1.04 billion and the fair value of contingent consideration 
of USD 239 million. The purchase price allocation 
resulted in net identiﬁable assets of USD 754 million, 
consisting primarily of IPR&D intangible assets of USD 
344 million, other intangible assets (scientific infrastruc-
ture) of USD 473 million, cash and cash equivalents of 
USD 80 million, net deferred tax liabilities of USD 133 
million and other net liabilities of USD 10 million. Good-
will amounted to USD 528 million. 
The results of operations since the date of acquisi-
tion were not material.
Acquisition of MorphoSys AG
On February 5, 2024, Novartis entered into an agree-
ment to acquire MorphoSys AG (MorphoSys), a Germa-
ny-based, global biopharmaceutical company develop-
ing innovative medicines in oncology. The acquisition of 
MorphoSys adds to our oncology pipeline pelabresib, a 
late-stage BET inhibitor for myelofibrosis and tulmime-
tostat, an early-stage investigational dual inhibitor of 
EZH2 and EZH1 for solid tumors or lymphomasis. 
On April 11, 2024, Novartis, through a subsidiary, com-
menced a voluntary public takeover offer (the “Offer”) to 
acquire all outstanding shares of MorphoSys for EUR 68 
per share, representing a total consideration of approx-
imately EUR 2.6 billion in cash on a fully diluted basis. 
The settlement of the Offer was conditional on a mini-
mum acceptance threshold of 65% of the MorphoSys 
outstanding shares. 
Novartis purchased during the Offer acceptance 
period MorphoSys shares on the market for a total 
amount of EUR 0.3 billion (USD 0.3 billion). The closing 
conditions of the Offer, including the minimum accep-
tance threshold of 65%, were fulfilled by the end of the 
Offer acceptance period, and the acquisition of Morpho-
Sys closed on May 23, 2024, with the settlement pay-
ment amounting to EUR 1.7 billion (USD 1.9 billion) to the 
MorphoSys shareholders for their tendered shares. Sub-
sequent to May 23, 2024, Novartis acquired additional 
MorphoSys outstanding shares through the German 
statutory two-week extension period of the Offer (end-
ing on May 30, 2024) for EUR 0.3 billion (USD 0.3 billion). 
As a result, as at May 30, 2024, Novartis held 89.7% of 
the total outstanding share capital of MorphoSys. Total 
cash paid for the MorphoSys shares purchased by 
Novartis through to the end of the statutory two-week 
extension period of the Offer amounted to EUR 2.3 bil-
lion (USD 2.5 billion). Non-controlling interests repre-
sented 10.3% of the MorphoSys outstanding shares 
amounting to USD 0.1 billion and were recognized in 
equity. 
In June 2024, outside the Offer Novartis purchased 
an additional 1.7% of MorphoSys shares for EUR 44 mil-
lion (USD 47 million). As a result, at June 30, 2024, 
Novartis held approximately 91.4% of outstanding Mor-
phoSys shares. 
On July 4, 2024, Novartis filed a public purchase offer 
to delist the MorphoSys shares admitted to trading on 
regulated markets and acquire all MorphoSys AG shares 
and American Depository Shares (ADS) not held directly 
by Novartis. In August 2024, the delisting of the 
­MorphoSys shares admitted to trading on regulated mar-
kets was completed, and Novartis purchased an addi-
tional 3.2% of ­MorphoSys shares for EUR 83 million 
(USD 90 million). As a result, at September 30, 2024, 
Novartis held approximately 94.5% of the outstanding 
­MorphoSys shares. 
On October 15, 2024, the “squeeze-out” of the 
remaining minority shareholders of ­MorphoSys was 
completed by way of a merger into a wholly-owned 
Novartis entity. As a result, Novartis held 100% of the 
outstanding shares of ­MorphoSys and non-controlling

interests in equity were reduced to nil. On October 21, 
2024, Novartis paid EUR 144 million (USD 156 million) to 
the former remaining minority shareholders in connec-
tion with the “squeeze-out.” 
The fair value of the total purchase consideration for 
the 89.7% stake held on May 30, 2024, was USD 2.5 bil-
lion (including cash acquired). The purchase price allo-
cation resulted in net identifiable assets of USD 0.7 bil-
lion, consisting primarily of intangible assets other than 
goodwill of USD 1.1 billion, comprising IPR&D intangible 
assets of USD 0.6 billion and other intangible assets 
(customer out-licensing contracts) of USD 0.5 billion, 
financial investments and other receivables of USD 0.2 
billion, marketable securities of USD 0.4 billion, cash and 
cash equivalents of USD 0.2 billion, financial debt to third 
parties of USD 0.9 billion, net deferred tax liabilities of 
USD 0.1 billion and other net liabilities of USD 0.2 billion. 
Non-controlling interests amounted to USD 0.1 billion, 
which were recognized at the non-controlling interests’ 
proportionate share of ­MorphoSys identifiable net 
assets. Goodwill as at the acquisition date amounted to 
USD 1.9 billion. 
The results of operations since the date of acquisi-
tion were not material.
Following the completion of management’s analysis 
of the third-party integrated safety report related to cer-
tain clinical trial data readouts, that became available 
prior to closing of the MorphoSys acquisition, the neces-
sity to perform an interim impairment test of the good-
will attributable to the MorphoSys business acquired at 
the provisional level of the grouping of CGUs of the Mor-
phoSys business was triggered. This impairment test 
required the use of valuation techniques to estimate the 
fair value less cost of disposal of the MorphoSys busi-
ness. These valuations required the use of management 
assumptions and estimates related to the MorphoSys 
business’ future cash flows and assumptions on, among 
others, discount rate (8.5%) and terminal growth/decline 
rates (-15.0%). These fair value measurements are clas-
sified as “Level 3” in the fair value hierarchy. The section 
“—Goodwill and intangible assets other than goodwill” 
in Note 1 provides additional information on key assump-
tions that are highly sensitive in the estimation of fair val-
ues using valuation techniques. The interim impairment 
test indicated an impairment of the goodwill attributable 
to the MorphoSys business in the amount of USD 0.9 
billion, which was recognized as “Other expense” in the 
consolidated income statement. As at December 31, 
2024, the remaining carrying value of the goodwill attrib-
utable to the MorphoSys business amounting to USD 1.0 
billion was allocated to the grouping of CGUs at the level 
of the operating segment of the Company, which is the 
level where the future synergies will be realized. 
Significant acquisitions of 
businesses in 2023
Acquisition of DTx Pharma, Inc.
In the second quarter of 2023, Novartis entered into an 
agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of DTx 
Pharma, Inc. (DTx), a US based, pre-clinical stage bio-
technology company focused on leveraging its propri-
etary FALCON platform to develop siRNA therapies for 
neuroscience indications. DTx’s lead program, DTx-1252 
targets the root cause of CMT1A—the overexpression of 
PMP22, a protein that causes the myelin sheath that sup-
ports and insulates nerves in the peripheral nervous sys-
tem to function abnormally. The transaction also includes 
two additional pre-clinical programs for other neurosci-
ence indications. The transaction closed on July 14, 
2023.  
The purchase price consisted of a cash payment of 
USD 0.6 billion and potential additional milestones of up 
to USD 0.5 billion, which the DTx shareholders are eligi-
ble to receive upon the achievement of specified mile-
stones. 
The fair value of the total purchase consideration was 
USD 0.6 billion. The amount consisted of a cash payment 
of USD 0.6 billion and the fair value of contingent con-
sideration of USD 30 million, which DTx shareholders are 
eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified 
milestones. The purchase price allocation resulted in net 
identifiable assets of USD 0.4 billion, consisting primar-
ily of IPR&D intangible assets of USD 0.4 billion, cash of 
USD 0.1 billion and net deferred tax liabilities of USD 0.1 
billion. Goodwill amounted to USD 0.2 billion. 
The 2023 results of operations since the date of 
acquisition were not material.
Acquisition of Chinook Therapeutics, Inc
On June 12, 2023, Novartis entered into an agreement 
to acquire all outstanding shares of Chinook Therapeu-
tics, Inc. (Chinook Therapeutics), a US based clinical 
stage biopharmaceutical company with two late-stage 
medicines in development for rare, severe chronic kid-
ney diseases. The acquisition closed on August 11, 2023. 
The purchase price consisted of a cash payment of 
USD 3.2 billion and potential additional payments of up 
to USD 0.3 billion, which Chinook Therapeutics share-
holders are eligible to receive upon the achievement of 
specified milestones.
The fair value of the total purchase consideration was 
USD 3.3 billion. The amount consisted of an upfront cash 
payment of USD 3.2 billion and the fair value of contin-
gent consideration of USD 0.1 billion, which Chinook 
Therapeutics shareholders are eligible to receive upon 
achievement of specified milestones. The purchase price 
allocation resulted in net identifiable assets of USD 2.4 
billion, consisting primarily of IPR&D intangible assets of 
USD 2.5 billion, net deferred tax liabilities of USD 0.4 bil-
lion and other net assets of USD 0.3 billion, including 
cash of USD 0.1 billion. Goodwill amounted to USD 0.9 
billion.
The 2023 results of operations since the date of 
acquisition were not material.
Distribution of Sandoz Group AG to 
Novartis AG shareholders
On July 18, 2023, Novartis announced that its Board of 
Directors had unanimously endorsed the proposed sep-
aration of the Sandoz business to create an independent 
company by way of a spin-off and to seek shareholder 
approval for the spin-off of the Sandoz  business into a 
separately traded standalone company, following the 
complete structural separation of the Sandoz business

into a standalone company (the Sandoz business or 
Sandoz Group AG) and subject to the satisfaction of cer-
tain conditions and Novartis AG shareholder approval.
At the EGM held on September 15, 2023, Novartis AG 
shareholders approved a special distribution by way of 
a dividend in kind to effect the spin-off of Sandoz Group 
AG, subject to the completion of certain conditions prec-
edent to the distribution. Upon shareholder approval, the 
Sandoz business was reported as discontinued opera-
tions and the distribution liability was recognized at its 
fair value, which exceeded the carrying value of the 
Sandoz business net assets.
The conditions precedent to the spin-off were met 
and on October 3, 2023 the spin-off of the Sandoz busi-
ness was effected by way of a distribution of a dividend 
in kind of Sandoz Group AG shares to Novartis AG share-
holders and American Depositary Receipt (ADR) hold-
ers (the Distribution). Through the Distribution, each 
Novartis AG shareholder received one Sandoz Group 
AG share for every five Novartis AG shares and each 
Novartis ADR holder received one Sandoz ADR for every 
five Novartis ADR that they held at the close of business 
on October 3, 2023. As of October 4, 2023, the shares 
of Sandoz Group AG have been listed on the SIX Swiss 
Exchange (SIX) under the stock symbol “SDZ”.
On September 18, 2023, the Sandoz business entered 
into financing arrangements with a group of banks under 
which on September 28, 2023, it borrowed a total amount 
of USD 3.3 billion. These borrowings consisted of a 
bridge loan in EUR (EUR 2.4 billion) and term loans in 
EUR (EUR 0.2 billion) and USD (USD 0.5 billion). In addi-
tion, the Sandoz business borrowed approximately USD 
0.4 billion under a number of local bilateral facilities in 
different countries. This resulted in a total gross debt of 
USD 3.7 billion. These outstanding borrowings of the 
Sandoz business legal entities were recognized in the 
September 30, 2023 consolidated balance sheet within 
Liabilities related to discontinued operations and within 
financing activities cash flows from discontinued oper-
ations. Prior to the Distribution on October 3, 2023, 
Sandoz business legal entities paid approximately USD 
3.3 billion in cash to Novartis and its affiliates through a 
series of intercompany transactions.
At the Distribution date on October 3, 2023, the div-
idend in kind distribution liability to effect the Distribu-
tion (spin-off) of the Sandoz business amounted to USD 
14.0 billion, measured by reference to the October 4, 
2023 opening Sandoz Group AG share price and apply-
ing a control premium. The dividend in kind distribution 
liability was recorded as a reduction to equity (retained 
earnings) and remained in excess of the then carrying 
value of the Sandoz business net assets, which amounted 
to USD 8.6 billion (see Note 29).
Certain consolidated foundations own Novartis AG 
dividend-bearing shares that restricts their availability 
for use by Novartis. These Novartis AG shares are 
accounted for as treasury shares. Through the Distribu-
tion, these foundations received Sandoz Group AG 
shares representing an approximate 4.31% equity inter-
est in Sandoz Group AG. Upon the loss of control of 
Sandoz Group AG through the Distribution on October 
3, 2023, the financial investment in Sandoz Group AG 
was recognized at its initial fair value based on the open-
ing traded share price of Sandoz Group AG on October 
4, 2023 (a Level 1 hierarchy valuation). At initial recogni-
tion, on October 4, 2023, the Sandoz Group AG finan-
cial investment had a fair value of USD 0.5 billion, and 
was reported in the fourth quarter of 2023 on the con-
solidated balance sheet as a financial asset. Manage-
ment has designated this investment at fair value through 
other comprehensive income.
The total non-taxable, non-cash gain recognized at 
the Distribution date of the spin-off of the Sandoz busi-
ness amounted to USD 5.9 billion, which consists of:

Significant transactions in 2022
Acquisition of Gyroscope Therapeutics Holdings 
plc
On December 22, 2021, Novartis entered into an agree-
ment to acquire all outstanding shares of Gyroscope 
Therapeutics Holdings plc (Gyroscope), a UK-based 
ocular gene therapy company. Gyroscope focuses on 
the discovery and development of gene therapy treat-
ments for retinal indications. The purchase price con-
sisted of a cash payment of USD 0.8 billion, subject to 
certain customary purchase price adjustments, and 
potential additional milestone payments of up to USD 0.7 
billion, which Gyroscope shareholders are eligible to 
receive upon the achievement of specified milestones. 
The acquisition closed on February 17, 2022. 
The fair value of the total purchase consideration was 
USD 1.0 billion. The amount consisted of an upfront cash 
payment of USD 0.8 billion (including customary pur-
chase price adjustments) and the fair value of contingent 
consideration of USD 0.2 billion, which Gyroscope share-
holders are eligible to receive upon the achievement of 
specified milestones. The purchase price allocation 
resulted in net identifiable assets of USD 0.9 billion, con-
sisting primarily of IPR&D intangible assets of USD 1.1 
billion and net deferred tax liabilities of USD 0.2 billion. 
Goodwill amounted to USD 0.1 billion.
The 2022 results of operations since the date of 
acquisition were not material.

The significant business acquisitions in 2024, were Kate 
Therapeutics, Mariana Oncology and MorphoSys. The 
goodwill arising out of 2024 acquisitions is not tax 
deductible and is attributable to synergies, including the 
cost synergies from pre-acquisition in-licensed IP from 
MorphoSys, accounting for deferred tax liabilities on 
acquired assets, and the assembled workforce. In 2024, 
an impairment of goodwill was recognized related to the 
MorphoSys business acquisition of USD 0.9 billion. See 
Acquisition of MorphoSys AG section of this Note 2 for 
additional information. 
In 2023, the significant business acquisitions were 
the acquisition of DTx Pharma and Chinook Therapeu-
tics. The goodwill arising out of these acquisitions is 
attributable to synergies, accounting for deferred tax lia-
bilities on acquired assets and the assembled workforce. 
In 2023, no goodwill was tax deductible.
3. Operating segment
Following the September 15, 2023, shareholder approval 
of the spin-off of the Sandoz business (see Note 1 and 
Note 2), the Company reported its consolidated finan-
cial statements as “continuing operations” and “discon-
tinued operations” (see Note 1).
Continuing operations include the retained business 
activities of Novartis, comprising the innovative medicines 
business (previously the Innovative Medicines Division) 
and the continuing corporate activities.
Discontinued operations include the Sandoz generic 
pharmaceuticals and biosimilars business (the Sandoz 
Division) and certain corporate activities attributable to 
Sandoz’s business, as well as certain expenses related 
to the spin-off. Included in 2023 is also the IFRS Account-
ing Standards non-cash, non-taxable net gain on the Dis-
tribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG sharehold-
ers. For further details and disclosures on discontinued 
operations, refer to Note 1, Note 2 and Note 29.
The Company’s continuing operations are engaged 
in the research, development, manufacturing, distribu-
tion, commercialization and sale of innovative medicines, 
with a focus on the core therapeutic areas: cardiovas-
cular, renal and metabolic; immunology; neuroscience; 
oncology; and established brands.
Following the spin-off of the Sandoz business, on 
October 3, 2023, Novartis operates as a single global 
operating segment innovative medicines company that 
is engaged in the research, development, manufactur-
ing, distribution and commercialization and sale of 
innovative medicines. The Company’s research, devel-
opment manufacturing and supply of products and func-
tional activities are managed globally on a vertically inte-
grated basis. Commercial efforts that coordinate 
marketing, sales and distribution of these products are 
organized by geographic region, therapeutic area and 
established brands.

 Analysis of tax rate
Novartis has a substantial business presence in many 
countries and is therefore subject to income taxes in dif-
ferent tax jurisdictions. This leads to differences in 
income and expense items that are non-taxable or 
non-deductible (permanent differences) or are taxed at 
different statutory tax rates in those tax jurisdictions. As 
a result, there is a difference between our applicable tax 
rate and effective tax rate.
The applicable tax rate changes from year to year 
due to changes in the mix of the Company’s pre-tax 
income and changes in statutory tax rates since it is 
­calculated as the weighted average tax rate based on 
the pre-tax income of each subsidiary. 
The main elements contributing to the difference 
between the Company’s overall applicable tax rate and 
the effective tax rate are shown in the following table:

Swiss Patent Box regime (+1.0%) and the effect of a non-deductible impairment of 
goodwill (+1.7%)	
The effective tax rate of Novartis fluctuates primarily as a 
result of, among other factors, changes in pre-tax income 
between countries with varying statutory tax rates and the 
effects of disallowed expenditures, income not subject to tax, 
tax credits and allowances, tax rate changes on current and 
deferred tax assets and liabilities, write-down of investments 
in subsidiaries, and changes in uncertain tax positions. The 
table above provides the details of the significant items that 
impact the comparability of the effective tax rate between 
years.
In December 2021, the OECD issued model rules for a 
new global minimum tax framework (Pillar Two). Novartis is 
within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules. A num-
ber of governments in countries in which Novartis operates 
are in the process of enacting or have enacted tax legislation 
to comply with Pillar Two. 
In December 2023, Switzerland partially implemented Pil-
lar Two, whereby effective from January 1, 2024, a 15% min-
imum taxation is assessed on Pillar Two qualifying profits 
earned by companies domiciled in Switzerland (Qualified 
Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax). This Qualified Domestic 
Minimum Top-Up Tax (QDMTT) does not apply to the Pillar 
Two qualifying profits earned by a company’s affiliates domi-
ciled in tax jurisdictions outside of Switzerland. The QDMTT 
legislation in Switzerland had no material impact to our 
current income tax expense in 2024.   
On September 4, 2024, Switzerland enacted the 
Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) effective January 1, 2025, 
which complements the QDMTT. This IIR imposes a 15% 
minimum top-up tax on the profits of foreign subsidiar-
ies of Swiss-based multinational companies. Novartis 
estimates that the IIR will have no material impact to our 
consolidated financial position, income statement and 
cash flows.
The Pillar Two tax legislation enacted in 2024 and 
2023 in Switzerland and other countries in which we 
operate had no material impact to the Company’s results 
of operations, financial condition and cash flows in 2024 
and 2023. 
For disclosures on income taxes paid in 2024, 2023 and 
2022, see Note 23.2.

Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing 
net income attributable to shareholders of Novartis AG 
by the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
in a reporting period. This calculation excludes the aver-
age number of issued shares purchased by the Com-
pany and held as treasury shares.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of 
shares outstanding is adjusted to assume the vesting of 
dilutive restricted shares (RSs), restricted share units 
(RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs), and in 2022 
also the conversion of potentially dilutive shares arising 
from options on Novartis shares under employee com-
pensation plans that have been issued. In January 2023, 
all outstanding options under these plans expired. As a 
result, there were no options on Novartis shares issued 
or outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
No RSs, RSUs or PSUs in 2024, 2023 and 2022, and 
no options in 2022 were excluded from the calculation 
of diluted EPS, as all were dilutive. 
8. Changes in consolidated statements 
of comprehensive income
The consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
include the Company’s net income for the year as well as all 
other valuation adjustments recorded in the Company’s con-
solidated balance sheet, which under IFRS Accounting 
Standards are not recorded in the consolidated income state-
ment. These include fair value adjustments on financial instru-
ments, actuarial gains or losses on defined benefit pension 
plans, and currency translation effects, all net of taxes.

 10. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities
The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a cor-
responding lease liability for all arrangements in which 
it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 12 months 
or less (short-term leases) and low-value leases. For 
these short-term and low-value leases, the Company 
recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The 
Company allocates the consideration in the lease con-
tract to the lease and non-lease components on the basis 
of the relative standalone price of each component. 
The portion of the lease payments attributable to the 
repayment of lease liabilities is recognized in cash flows 
used in financing activities, and the portion attributable 
to the payment of interest is included in cash flows from 
operating activities.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line 
basis from the commencement date of the lease over 
the shorter of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or 
the end of the lease term. 
Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment 
whenever there is an indication that the balance sheet 
carrying amount may not be recoverable using cash flow 
projections for the useful life.

1	 The 2024 estimated timing of the commitments for leases not yet commenced are as follows: 2025 USD 57 million, 2026 USD 15 million, 2027 USD 4 million, 2028 USD 4 million, 
2029 USD 4 million and thereafter USD 39 million.
At December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there 
were no material future cash outflows, including exten-
sion options, excluded from the measurement of lease 
liabilities. The Company’s most material lease with a 
lease term extension, representing a lease liability value 
of USD 0.7 billion (2023: USD 0.7 billion), has a deter-
mined lease term end date of 2071 (2023: 2071). Non-en-
forceable extension options of up to 10 years have not 
been included within the measurement of this lease lia-
bility, and do not have a material impact to the carrying 
value of the lease for either 2024 or 2023. Should the 
landlord agree to a lease extension, rent will be refer-
enced to the market rates as at the commencement of 
the extension period.
In 2024, the Company completed two (2023: two, 
2022: three) sale and leaseback transactions for certain 
property, plant and equipment as part of the Company’s 
facilities strategy. The transactions resulted in net cash 
inflows of USD 9 million (2023: USD 273 million, 2022: 
USD 49 million) and the recognition of USD 14 million of 
lease liabilities (2023: USD 146 million, 2022: USD 23 
million), and USD 2 million of right-of-use assets (2023: 
USD 109 million, 2022: USD 13 million). The right-of-use 
assets value reflects the proportion of the property, plant 
and equipment retained. Extension options have been 
included where management believe that such options 
will be exercised. The liabilities reflect the net present 
value of future lease payments. The net loss on the sale 
and leaseback transactions amounted to USD 10 million 
(2023: net gain USD 18 million, 2022: net gain USD 17 
million).
The following table provides additional disclosures 
related to continuing operations right-of-use assets and 
lease liabilities for 2024, 2023 and 2022:

1	 The weighted average interest rate is 4.0% (2023: 3.5%, 2022: 3.3%). Interest on 
lease liabilities as at December 31, 2024, is estimated to be USD 56 million for 2025 
and USD 1.3 billion thereafter.
2	 Cash flows from short-term and low-value leases are included within total net cash 
flows from operating activities. The portfolio of short-term leases to which the 
Company is committed to at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, is similar to the 
portfolio of short-term leases the Company entered into during 2024, 2023 and 2022.
3	Included within total net cash flows from operating activities
4	Reported as cash outflows in financing activities net of lease incentives received, if 
any.
The net investment held and income from subleasing 
right-of-use assets, as well as income from leasing 
Novartis property, plant and equipment to third parties 
were not significant for 2024, 2023, or 2022.

1	 Represents the cost of assets and accumulated depreciation/impairments at January 1, 2023, related to the Sandoz business reported as discontinued operations, and the net 
transfers between discontinued and continuing operations from January 1, 2023 to October 3, 2023. Note 29 provides disclosure of discontinued operations additions, 
depreciation charge, impairment charge and reversals of impairment change.
2	Additions to currently marketed products include USD 0.1 billion of capitalized development costs.
3	Derecognition of assets that are no longer being used or developed and are not considered to have a significant disposal value or other alternative use. Disposals include the 
divested currently marketed product Xiidra.
As at December 31, 2024, the most significant intangi-
ble assets within the Currently marketed products cat-
egory are Leqvio (acquisition of The Medicines Com-
pany) and Zolgensma (acquisition of Avexis Inc.). As at 
December 31, 2024, the carrying value and remaining 
amortization period for Leqvio is USD 6.3 billion and 11 
years, respectively (2023: USD 6.8 billion and 12 years, 
respectively), and for Zolgensma USD 4.5 billion and 6 
years, respectively (2023: USD 5.2 billion and 7 years, 
respectively). 
The estimated useful life of Currently marketed prod-
ucts ranges from 5 to 20 years and amortization charges, 
impairments and impairment reversals are recognized in 
the consolidated income statement on the line “Cost of 
goods sold.”
The estimated useful lives of Other intangible assets 
ranges from 3 to 15 years and amortization charges, 
impairments and impairment reversals are recognized in 
the consolidated income statement on the lines “Cost of 
goods sold,” “Selling, general and administration,” 
“Research and development” or “Other expense,” or for 
impairment reversals “Other income,” depending on the 
nature and use of the other intangible asset.
Impairment charges for IPR&D are recorded in the 
consolidated income statement line “Research and 
development.” 
The Company has no indefinite useful life intangible 
asset other than goodwill.
The Company’s cash-generating unit to which good-
will is allocated, as at December 31, 2024 and 2023, is 
at the level of the single global operating segment, which 
is comprised of a group of smaller cash-generating units. 
The valuation method of the recoverable amount of the 
operating segment to which goodwill is allocated is 
based on the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impair-
ment charges are recorded under “Other expense” in 
the consolidated income statement.
The following assumptions were used in the goodwill 
impairment testing calculation:
(As a percentage)	
	
Terminal growth rate	
1.3	
Discount rate (post-tax)	
7.0	
The discount rates consider the Company’s weighted 
average cost of capital, adjusted to approximate the 
weighted average cost of capital of a comparable mar-
ket participant.
The fair value less costs of disposal for the cash-gen-
erating unit containing goodwill, is reviewed for the 
impact of reasonably possible changes in key assump-
tions. In particular, we considered an increase in the dis-
count rate, a decrease in the terminal growth rate, and 
certain negative impacts on the forecasted cash flows. 
These reasonably possible changes in key assumptions 
did not indicate an impairment.
“Note 1. Accounting policies—Goodwill and intangible 
assets other than goodwill” provides additional disclo-
sures on how the Company performs goodwill and intan-
gible asset impairment testing.

 Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for with-
holding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the 
remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, insofar as 
the Company has the ability to control any future rever-
sal and the unremitted earnings are retained in the for-
eign subsidiaries for reinvestment. The total unremitted

eign subsidiaries that would be subject to withholding 
tax or other taxes if remitted to the Company were esti-
mated to be approximately USD 39 billion in 2024 (2023: 
USD 34 billion).

Trade receivable balances represent amounts due from 
our customers, which are mainly drug wholesalers, retail-
ers, private health systems, government agencies, man-
aged care providers, pharmacy benefit managers and 
government-supported healthcare systems. In particu-
lar, we monitor the level of trade receivables in countries 
deemed to have an elevated credit risk. We consider 
macroeconomic environment, historical experience, 
country and political risk, in addition to other relevant 
information when assessing risk. These risk factors are 
monitored regularly to determine any adjustments in risk 
classification. The majority of the past due trade receiv-
ables from elevated credit risk countries are due from 
local governments or from government-funded entities. 
Deteriorating credit and economic conditions as well as 
other factors in these elevated credit risk countries have 
resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in 
the average length of time that it takes to collect these 
trade receivables, and may require the Company to 
re-evaluate the expected credit loss amount of these 
trade receivables in future periods. At December 31, 
2024, amounts past due for more than one year are not 
significant in elevated credit risk countries.

1	 Approximately 86.0 million treasury shares (2023: 93.8 million; 2022: 99.0 million) are held in Novartis entities that restrict their availability for use.
2	Novartis reduced its share capital by canceling shares that were repurchased on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line during previous years.
3	Shares repurchased on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line under the CHF 10 billion share buyback authority approved at the 2021 Annual General Meeting (AGM), the 
additional CHF 10 billion authority approved at the 2022 AGM and the additional CHF 10 billion authority approved at the 2023 AGM. Since March 20, 2024, the share repurchases 
are executed under the authority approved at the 2023 AGM as all earlier authorizations are fully exhausted.
4	Shares acquired from employees, which were previously granted to them under the respective equity-based compensation plans
5	Shares delivered as a result of options being exercised and physical share deliveries related to equity-based compensation plans
18.1) The amount available for distribution as a dividend

on their trade date, which is different from the settlement 
date, when the transaction is ultimately effected. Trea-
sury shares are deducted from consolidated equity at 
their nominal per share value. Differences between the 
nominal amount and the transaction price on purchases 
or sales of treasury shares with third parties, or the value 
of services received for the shares allocated to employ-
ees as part of share-based compensation arrangements, 
are recorded in “Retained earnings” in the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity.

additional CHF 10 billion authority approved at the 2022 AGM and the additional CHF 10 billion authority approved at the 2023 AGM. Since March 20, 2024, the share repurchases 
are executed under the authority approved at the 2023 AGM as all earlier authorizations are fully exhausted.
2	Shares acquired from employees, which were previously granted to them under the respective equity-based compensation plans
3	Shares delivered as a result of options being exercised related to equity-based compensation plans and the delivery of treasury shares. The average share price of the shares 
delivered was significantly below market price, reflecting the strike price of the options exercised.
4	Equity-settled share-based compensation is expensed in the consolidated income statement in accordance with the vesting period of the equity-based compensation plans. The 
value for the shares and options granted is credited to consolidated equity over the respective vesting period. In addition, tax benefits arising from tax-deductible amounts 
exceeding the expense recognized in the income statement are credited to equity.
18.3) Changes in non-controlling interests represent the 
impact on the non-controlling interest of transactions 
with minority shareholders, such as change in ownership 
percentage, dividend payments and other equity trans-
actions. 
18.4) Other movements include, for subsidiaries in hyper-
inflationary economies, the impact of the application of 
IAS Standards 29 “Financial reporting in Hyperinflation-
ary Economies.” See Note 28 for additional disclosures.
18.5) Transaction costs in 2023 of USD 214 million, net 
of tax of USD 29 million, that were directly attributable 
to the Distribution (spin-off) of the Sandoz business to 
Novartis AG shareholders and that would otherwise have 
been avoided, were recorded as a deduction from equity 
(retained earnings). See Note 1.
18.6) In 2023, in connection with the Distribution (spin-
off) of the Sandoz business, Novartis AG shareholders 
approved at the EGM held on September 15, 2023, a 
decrease in Novartis AG share capital in the amount of 
CHF 22.8 million (USD 17.1 million). The capital decrease 
resulted in a reduction of the nominal value of the Novartis 
AG shares by CHF 0.01 from CHF 0.50 per share to CHF 
0.49 per share. 
18.7) In December 2021, Novartis entered into an irrevo-
cable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to 
repurchase Novartis shares on the second trading line 
under its up-to USD 15.0 billion share buyback. The 
arrangement was updated in July 2022, December 2022, 
and May 2023, and concluded in June 2023. Novartis 
was able to cancel this arrangement at any time but could 
have been subject to a 90-day waiting period. As of 
December 31, 2022, these waiting period conditions 
were not applicable and as a result, there was no require-
ment to record a liability under this arrangement as of 
December 31, 2022.
In June 2023, Novartis entered into an irrevocable, 
non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repur-
chase 11.7 million Novartis shares on the second trading 
line, which concluded in July 2023.
In July 2023, Novartis entered into a new irrevocable, 
non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repur-
chase Novartis shares on the second trading line under 
its new up-to USD 15.0 billion share buyback. In June 
2024, Novartis amended the arrangement to include the 
repurchase of an additional 8.7 million Novartis shares 
on the second trading line to mitigate the impact of share 
deliveries under the equity-based compensation plans 
for employees. These additional repurchases concluded 
in October 2024. Novartis was able to cancel this 
arrangement at any time but could have been subject to 
a 90-day waiting period. As of December 31, 2024 and 
2023, these waiting period conditions were not applica-
ble and as a result, there was no requirement to record 
a liability under this arrangement as of December 31, 
2024 and 2023.
18.8) At December 31, 2022, the market maker held 3 
million written call options, originally issued as part of 
the share-based compensation for employees, that have 
not yet been exercised. The weighted average exercise 
price of these options at December 31, 2022, was USD 
66.07 and they had contractual lives of 10 years, with 
remaining lives less than one year. In the first quarter of 
2023, the market maker exercised 3 million written call 
options and as a result there were no written call options 
outstanding at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 
2024.

All bonds are initially recorded at the amount of proceeds 
received, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently 
carried at amortized cost, with the difference between 
the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the amount 
due on redemption being recognized as a charge to the 
consolidated income statement over the period of the 
relevant bond. Financial debts, including current finan-
cial debts, contain only general default covenants. The 
Company is in compliance with these covenants.
The percentage of fixed-rate financial debt to total 
financial debt was 84% as at December 31, 2024, and 
2023.
The average interest rate on total financial debt in 
2024 was 3.2% (2023: 2.9%).
Note 28 contains a maturity table of the Company’s 
future contractual interest payments commitments.

Novartis believes that its total provisions are adequate based upon currently available information. However, given 
the inherent difficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, Novartis may incur additional costs beyond the amounts 
provided. Management believes that such additional amounts, if any, would not be material to the Company’s finan-
cial condition but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in a given period.

Sandoz business reported as discontinued operations. Notes 1, 2 and 29 provide 
disclosures related to discontinued operations.
2	 Cash payments from continuing operations were USD 5 million in 2022.
3	 Releases of provisions credited to the consolidated income statement from 
continuing operations were USD 18 million in 2022.
4	Additions to provisions charged to the consolidated income statement from 
continuing operations were USD 6 million in 2022.
The significant components of the environmental reme-
diation provisions consist of costs to sufficiently clean 
and refurbish contaminated sites to the extent neces-
sary, and to continue surveillance at sites where the envi-
ronmental remediation exposure is less significant. 
A substantial portion of the environmental remedia-
tion provisions relate to the remediation of Basel regional 
landfills in the adjacent border areas in Switzerland and 
France. The provisions are reassessed on an annual 
basis and adjusted as necessary. 
In the United States, Novartis has been named under 
federal legislation (the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as 
amended) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in 
respect of certain sites. Novartis actively participates in, 
or monitors, the cleanup activities at the sites in which it 
is a PRP. The provision takes into consideration the num-
ber of other PRPs at each site as well as the identity and 
financial position of such parties in light of the joint and 
several nature of the liability. 
The expected timing of the related cash outflows as 
of December 31, 2024, is currently projected as follows:
	
Expected 	
(USD millions)	
cash outflows

Due after 10 years

Total environmental remediation provisions

Provisions for product liabilities, 
governmental investigations and 
other legal matters 
Novartis has established provisions for certain product 
liabilities, governmental investigations and other legal 
matters where a potential cash outflow is probable, and 
Novartis can make a reliable estimate of the amount of 
the outflow. These provisions represent the Company’s 
current best estimate of the total financial effect for the 
matters described below and for other less significant 
matters. Potential cash outflows reflected in a provision 
might be fully or partially offset by insurance in certain 
circumstances.
Novartis has not established provisions for potential 
damage awards for certain additional legal claims against 
its subsidiaries if Novartis currently believes that a pay-
ment is either not probable or cannot be reliably esti-
mated. These not-provisioned-for matters include indi-
vidual product liability cases and certain other legal 
matters. Plaintiffs have alleged claims in these matters 
and the Company does not believe that information about 
the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would 
be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings. 
This is due to a number of factors, including, but not lim-
ited to, the stage of proceedings, the entitlement of par-
ties to appeal a decision and clarity as to theories of lia-
bility, damages and governing law. It is therefore, not 
practicable to provide information about the potential 
financial impact of these matters. In addition, in some of 
these matters there are claims for punitive or multiple 
(treble) damages, civil penalties and disgorgement of 
profits that in the view of Novartis are either wholly or 
partially unspecified, or wholly or partially unquantifiable 
at present. The Company believes that information about 
these amounts claimed by plaintiffs generally is not 
meaningful for purposes of determining a reliable esti-
mate of a loss that is probable or more than remote.
A number of other legal matters are in such early 
stages, or the issues presented are such that the Com-
pany has not made any provisions, since it cannot cur-
rently estimate either a potential outcome or the amount 
of any potential losses. For these reasons, among oth-
ers, the Company generally is unable to make a reliable 
estimate of possible loss with respect to such cases. It 
is therefore not practicable to provide information about 
the potential financial impact of those cases.
There might also be cases for which the Company 
was able to make a reliable estimate of the possible loss 
or the range of possible loss, but the Company believes 
that publication of such information on a case-by-case 
basis would seriously prejudice the Company’s position 
in ongoing legal proceedings or in any related settlement 
discussions. Accordingly, in such cases, information has 
been disclosed with respect to the nature of the contin-
gency, but no disclosure is provided as to an estimate of 
the possible loss or range of possible loss.
Note 27 contains additional information on contin-
gent liabilities.

Summary of significant legal 
proceedings
The following is a summary of significant legal proceed-
ings to which Novartis or its subsidiaries are currently a 
party, or were a party and that concluded in 2024.
Investigations and related litigations
Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.) Gilenya 
marketing practices investigation and litigation
In 2013, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (NPC) 
received a civil investigative demand from the United 
States Attorney’s Office for the S.D.N.Y. requesting the 
production of documents and information relating to 
marketing practices for Gilenya, including the remuner-
ation of healthcare providers in connection therewith. In 
2017, the S.D.N.Y. and New York State declined to inter-
vene in claims raised by an individual relator in a qui tam 
complaint. In 2022, NPC’s motion to dismiss this com-
plaint was granted. In December 2024, the appeals court 
affirmed in part but remanded in part, sending the case 
back to the district court for further proceedings. The 
claims are being vigorously contested. 
Lucentis/Avastin® matters
In 2019, the French Competition Authority (FCA) issued 
a Statement of Objections against Novartis entities, 
alleging anti-competitive practices on the French mar-
ket for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treat-
ments for wet age-related macular degeneration from 
2008 to 2013. In 2020, the FCA issued a decision find-
ing that the Novartis entities had infringed competition 
law by abusing a dominant position and imposing a fine 
equivalent to approximately USD 452 million. Novartis 
paid the fine, again subject to recoupment, and appealed 
the FCA’s decision. In February 2023, the Paris Court of 
Appeal (Court) overturned the FCA’s decision which trig-
gered the reimbursement of the originally paid fine 
(recorded as “Other income” in the Company’s consoli-
dated income statement), and, in March 2023, the FCA 
appealed the Court’s decision.
Novartis is the subject of similar investigations and 
proceedings involving the competition authority in 
Greece and is currently in an appeal process in Turkey. 
Novartis continues to vigorously contest all claims in both 
countries. Novartis is also challenging policies and reg-
ulations allowing off-label/unlicensed use and reim-
bursement for economic reasons in Turkey.
Greece investigation
The Greek authorities are investigating legacy allega-
tions of potentially inappropriate economic benefits to 
healthcare providers (HCPs), government officials and 
others in Greece. These authorities include the Greek 
Coordinating Body for Inspection and Control, and the 
Greek Body of Prosecution of Financial Crime (SDOE), 
from which the Company received a summons in 2018 
and 2020. Novartis has cooperated in these investiga-
tions. In 2021, SDOE imposed on Novartis Hellas a fine 
equivalent to approximately USD 1.2 million; Novartis Hel-
las appealed the fine and, in September 2023, the Court 
overturned the decision and fine. The Greek State filed 
an appeal.  In 2022, the Greek State served a civil law-
suit on Novartis Hellas, seeking approximately USD 225 
million for moral damages allegedly arising from the con-
duct that was the subject of the Company’s 2020 set-
tlement with the US Department of Justice regarding 
allegations of inappropriate economic benefits in Greece 
that was disclosed in the 2020 Annual Report and the 
2020 Form 20-F. The claims are being vigorously con-
tested.
340B Drug Pricing Program litigation
NPC has brought litigation challenging a number of state 
statutes purporting to add further obligations on manu-
facturers under the federal 340B program as to the use 
of contract pharmacies in those states. NPC has also 
brought litigation challenging the federal government’s 
refusal to allow NPC to apply a rebate payment model 
for the 340B program.
In addition, in 2021 and 2023, two medical centers 
ﬁled Administrative Dispute Resolution proceedings 
against NPC, seeking the return of alleged overcharges 
resulting from NPC’s contract pharmacy policy. NPC has 
moved to dismiss these proceedings. Also in 2021, NPC 
received a civil investigative subpoena from the Office 
of the Attorney General of the State of Vermont (Ver-
mont AG) requesting the production of documents and 
information concerning NPC’s participation in the 340B 
Drug Pricing Program in Vermont. NPC responded by 
providing documents and information to the Vermont AG 
in 2021 and there have been no further actions since that 
time. 
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) litigation
In 2023, following the U.S. government’s selection of 
Entresto for the ﬁrst round of the IRA’s “Medicare Drug 
Price Negotiation Program,” NPC ﬁled a complaint in the 
U.S. District Court (USDC) for the District of New Jersey 
on the grounds that those drug price-setting provisions 
are unconstitutional under the First, Fifth and Eighth 
Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. In October 2024, 
the court granted the government’s motion for summary 
judgment. NPC has appealed to the Third Circuit. 
Product liability litigation
Tasigna
NPC is a defendant in more than 400 US product liabil-
ity actions involving Tasigna, alleging that the product 
caused various cardiovascular effects and that NPC 
failed to provide adequate warnings about those alleged 
side effects. State court actions are pending in a multi-
county litigation in Bergen County, New Jersey, and fed-
eral cases are pending in a multidistrict litigation in the 
Middle District of Florida. The claims are being vigorously 
contested.
Other matters
Shareholder derivative lawsuit
In 2021, NPC, Sandoz Inc., Novartis Capital Corporation 
and certain present and former directors and officers of 
Novartis were named as defendants, and Novartis was 
named as a nominal defendant, in a purported share-
holder derivative lawsuit filed in New York State Court. 
The plaintiffs, derivatively as purported Novartis share-
holders on behalf of Novartis, seek damages and other 
remedies based on alleged conduct by the corporate 
and individual defendants. In 2022, the court granted

Novartis motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which the plain-
tiffs have appealed.
Concluded legal matters
340B Drug Pricing Program litigation
In 2021, NPC received a notiﬁcation from the US Health 
Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) which 
stated that HRSA believes NPC’s contract pharmacy pol-
icy violates the 340B statute, and threatened potential 
enforcement action. NPC subsequently sued HRSA in 
the USDC for the District of Columbia to challenge 
HRSA’s determination and to enjoin HRSA from taking 
action with respect to NPC’s contract pharmacy policy. 
HRSA then referred the matter regarding NPC’s contract 
pharmacy policy to the Office of Inspector General of 
the US Department of Health and Human Services, which 
could result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties 
on NPC. The court issued a decision rejecting HRSA’s 
interpretation of the 340B statute, vacating the violation 
notiﬁcation and remanding the matter to HRSA. HRSA 
appealed, and the US Court of Appeals for the DC Cir-
cuit heard argument on the case in 2022. In May 2024, 
the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit issued a deci-
sion rejecting HRSA’s interpretation of the 340B statute 
and upholding NPC’s contract pharmacy policy. HRSA 
did not seek review from the US Supreme Court, and the 
decision is now final.
Swiss and EU investigation
In September 2022, the Swiss Competition Commission 
(COMCO) initiated an investigation of the acquisition of 
certain patents by Novartis from Genentech in April 2020 
and their subsequent enforcement against Eli Lilly and 
other parties, allegedly in an attempt to protect Cosentyx 
from competing products. COMCO investigated whether 
enforcement of the patents violated the Swiss Cartel Act. 
The European Commission also requested information 
from Novartis regarding this matter. COMCO and the EC 
have both formally closed their investigations with no 
findings and both stated that they did not find any indi-
cation of anticompetitive conduct.

Novartis believes that its total provisions for investiga-
tions, product liability, arbitration and other legal matters 
are adequate based upon currently available information. 
However, given the inherent difficulties in estimating lia-
bilities, there can be no assurance that additional liabil-
ities and costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts 
provided.
Discontinued operations
On October 4, 2023, the separation and spin-off of the 
Sandoz business was completed (Note 2). Pursuant to 
the Separation and Distribution Agreement that Novartis 
and Sandoz entered into in connection with that sepa-
ration and spin-off, Sandoz and Novartis agreed, subject 
to certain limitations, exclusions and conditions, that 
Sandoz would retain or assume (as applicable) liabilities, 
including pending and future claims that relate to the 
spun-off Sandoz business (whether arising prior to, at or 
after the date of execution of the Separation and Distri-
bution Agreement). Additionally, pursuant to the Sepa-
ration and Distribution Agreement, Sandoz agreed to 
indemnify Novartis and each of its directors, officers, 
managers, members, agents and employees against lia-
bilities incurred in connection with the spun-off Sandoz 
business.

 24. Post-employment benefits for employees
Defined benefit plans
In addition to the legally required social security schemes, 
the Company has numerous independent pension and 
other post-employment benefit plans. In most cases, 
these plans are externally funded in entities that are 
legally separate from the Company. For certain Com-
pany entities, however, no independent plan assets exist 
for the pension and other post-employment benefit obli-
gations of employees. In these cases, the related 
unfunded liability is included in the balance sheet. The 
defined benefit obligations (DBOs) of all major pension 
and other post-employment benefit plans are reap-
praised annually by independent actuaries using the pro-
jected unit credit method. Plan assets are recognized at 
fair value.
The major plans are based in Switzerland, the United 
States, the United Kingdom and Germany (2023: Swit-
zerland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany 
and Japan), which represent 96% (2023: 96%) of the 
Company’s total DBO for pension plans. Details of the 
plans in the two most significant countries, Switzerland 
and the United States, which represent 85% (2023: 84%) 
of the Company’s total DBO for post-employment ben-
efit plans, are provided below.
Swiss-based pension plans represent the most sig-
nificant portion of the Company’s total DBO and plan 
assets. For active insured members the benefits are 
linked to contributions paid into the plan, interest cred-
its granted and conversion rates applied. 
All benefits granted under Swiss-based pension 
plans are vested, and Swiss legislation prescribes that 
the employer has to contribute a fixed percentage of an 
employee’s pay to an external pension fund. Additional 
employer contributions may be required whenever the 
plan’s statutory funding ratio falls below a certain level. 
The employee also contributes to the plan. The pension 
plans are run by separate legal entities, each governed 
by a board of trustees that – for the principal plans – con-
sists of representatives nominated by Novartis and the 
active insured employees. The boards of trustees are 
responsible for the plan design and asset investment 
strategy.
The United States pension plans represent the sec-
ond-largest component of the Company’s total DBO and 
plan assets. The principal plans (Qualified Plans) are 
funded, whereas plans providing additional benefits for 
executives (Restoration Plans) are unfunded. Employer 
contributions are required for Qualified Plans whenever 
the statutory funding ratio falls below a certain level. 
Furthermore, in certain countries, employees are cov-
ered under other post-employment benefit plans and 
post-retirement medical plans.
In the US, other post-employment benefit plans con-
sist primarily of post-employment healthcare benefits, 
which have been closed to new members since 2015. 
Part of the costs of these plans is reimbursable under 
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Mod-
ernization Act of 2003. There is no statutory funding 
requirement for these plans. The Company is funding 
these plans to the extent that it is tax efficient.

Changes in the aforementioned actuarial assumptions 
can result in volatility in the accounting for the Compa-
ny’s pension plans in the consolidated financial state-
ments. This can result in substantial changes in the Com-
pany’s other comprehensive income, long-term liabilities 
and prepaid ­pension assets.
The DBO is significantly impacted by assumptions 
regarding the rate that is used to discount the actuari-
ally determined post-employment benefit liability. This 
rate is based on yields of high-quality ­corporate bonds 
in the country of the plan. Decreasing corporate bond 
yields decrease the discount rate, so that the DBO 
increases and the funded status decreases.
The impact of decreasing interest rates on a plan’s 
assets is more difficult to predict. A significant part of 
the plan assets is invested in bonds. Bond values usually 
rise when interest rates decrease and may therefore par-
tially compensate for the decrease in the funded status. 
Furthermore, pension assets also include significant 
holdings of equity instruments. Share prices usually tend 
to rise when interest rates decrease and therefore often 
counteract the negative impact of the rising defined ben-
efit obligation on the funded status (although the cor-
relation of interest rates with equities is not as strong as 
with bonds, especially in the short term).
The expected rate for pension increases significantly 
affects the DBO of most plans in Switzerland, Germany 
and the United Kingdom. Such pension increases also 
decrease the funded status, although there is no strong 
correlation between the value of the plan assets and 
pension/inflation increases.
Assumptions regarding life expectancy significantly 
impact the DBO. An increase in longevity increases the 
DBO. There is no offsetting impact from the plan assets, 
as no longevity bonds or swaps are held by the pension 
funds. The Company’s actuaries use mortality tables that 
take into account historic patterns and expected 
changes, such as further increases in longevity. 
The mortality assumptions used for the pension plans 
in Switzerland were based on BVG 2020 tables with 
future improvements based on the Continuous Mortality 
Investigation (‘CMI’) model. For the pension and postre-
tirement medical benefit plans in the US, the Society of 
Actuaries Pri-2012 mortality tables with generational 
improvements based on Scale MP-2021 are used.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the 
defined ­benefit pension obligation to the principal actu-
arial assumptions for the major plans in Switzerland, the 
United States, the United Kingdom and Germany on an

Cash and most of the equity and debt securities have a 
quoted market price in an active market. Real estate and 
alternative investments, which include hedge fund, pri-
vate equity, infrastructure and commodity investments, 
usually have a quoted market price or a regularly updated 
net asset value.
The strategic allocation of assets of the different pen-
sion plans is determined, based upon the local require-
ments and the market and economic environment, with 
the objective of achieving an investment return that, 
together with the contributions paid by the Company and 
its employees, is sufficient to maintain reasonable con-
trol over the various funding risks of the respective pen-
sion plans. The asset allocation currently includes invest-
ments in shares of Novartis AG as per the below table:

The weighted average duration of the major plans defined 
benefit pension obligation is 12.0 years (2023: 12.3 
years).
The Company’s ordinary contribution to the various 
pension plans is based on the rules of each plan. Addi-
tional contributions are made whenever this is required 
by statute or law (i.e., usually when statutory funding lev-
els fall below predetermined thresholds). The only sig-
nificant plan that requires additional funding is in Ger-
many.
The expected future cash flows over the upcoming

Equity-based participation plans can be separated into 
the following plans:
Annual Incentive
In 2024, 30% of the Annual Incentive for the Novartis 
Company CEO and other Executive Committee mem-
bers (ECN) was required to be deferred in Novartis 
shares, after the CEO and Executive Committee mem-
bers (ECN) have met their mandatory shareholding 
requirements, and the remainder was paid in cash. If the 
mandatory shareholding requirements were not met, 
50% was required to be deferred in Novartis shares and 
the remainder was paid in cash. In 2023 and 2022 the 
Annual Incentive for the Novartis Company CEO and 
other Executive Committee members (ECN) was paid 
50% in cash and 50% in Novartis restricted shares (RSs) 
or restricted share units (RSUs). In 2024 the Annual 
Incentive for a select portion of the Novartis manage-
ment leadership team is paid 100% in cash. In 2023 and 
2022, for a select portion of the Novartis management 
leadership team, the Annual Incentive was paid 70% in 
cash and 30% in RSs or RSUs. 
Both the ECN and a select portion of Novartis man-
agement leadership team can opt to invest up to the max-
imum cash portion of their Annual Incentive to receive 
further shares. From 2024 only a select portion of the 
Novartis management leadership team in Switzerland 
may invest its Annual Incentive in shares through the 
Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP). The cash por-
tion of the Annual Incentive is paid out during March in 
the year following the end of the performance period, 
and the shares are granted during January in the year 
following the end of the performance period. 
Employee share savings plan
Novartis operates employee share savings and purchase 
plans in certain countries. The most significant is 
described below.
The ESOP in Switzerland offers participants to 
choose to receive their Annual Incentive (i) 100% in 
shares, (ii) 50% in shares and 50% in cash, or (iii) 100% 
in cash. After the expiration of a three-year holding 
period for Novartis shares invested under the ESOP, par-
ticipants receive one matching share for every two 
invested shares. Employees eligible for the equity plan 
“Select” and a select portion of the Novartis 
management leadership team are not eligible to receive 
ESOP matching shares. A select portion of Novartis man-
agement leadership team is eligible to invest the Annual 
Incentive in Novartis shares from 2024 onwards. The 
Novartis Company CEO and the other Executive Com-
mittee members are not eligible to participate in this plan. 
Novartis Employee share purchase 
plan
In 2022 Novartis started to grant shares under the 
Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP 
enables employees to voluntarily purchase Novartis AG 
shares through payroll deductions at a 15% discounted 
price, up to a defined maximum amount. While the ESPP 
is global in scope, the first phase covered employees in 
North America (the US, Puerto Rico and Canada). Other 
countries’ employees became eligible to participate in 
the ESPP commencing in 2024, according to a multi-year 
phased implementation plan. The shares are not subject 
to a vesting period.
Novartis equity plan “Select”
The equity plan “Select” is a global equity incentive plan 
under which eligible employees may annually be awarded 
an equity grant. In 2024, the equity grants awarded under 
the “Select” plan are subject to a three-year staggered 
vesting period.  In 2023 and 2022, equity grants awarded 
under the Select plan were subject to a three-year cliff 
vesting period, and for eligible employees of selected 
Company units a four-year staggered vesting period. 
Executive Committee members and a select portion of 
Novartis management leadership team are not eligible 
to participate in the equity plan “Select.”
The equity plan “Select” currently allows participants 
employed and living in Switzerland to choose the form 
of their equity compensation in RSs or RSUs. In all other 
jurisdictions, RSs or RSUs are granted unilaterally.
Until 2013, participants could also choose to receive 
part or the entire grant in the form of tradable share 
options. All tradable share options expired on their 10th 
anniversary from the grant date, which was in January 
2023. As a result, at December 31, 2023, there were no 
outstanding options under the Novartis equity plan 
“Select.”
Long-Term Performance Plan
The Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP) is a global equity 
plan for the ECN, a select portion of Novartis manage-
ment leadership team and up to 2023 employees of Com-
pany units with specific targets.
Participants are granted a target number of perfor-
mance share units (PSUs) at the beginning of every per-
formance period, which are converted into unrestricted 
Novartis shares after the performance period. The actual 
payout depends on the achievement of the performance

measures and ranges between 0% and 200% of the 
granted amount. PSUs granted under the LTPP do not 
carry voting rights, but do carry dividend equivalents that 
are paid in unrestricted Novartis shares at the end of the 
performance period.
The LTPP awards are subject to a three-year perfor-
mance and vesting period. The performance criteria for 
the ECN are based on both Novartis internal perfor-
mance metrics and variable that can be observed in the 
market, which is the ranking of the Novartis total share-
holder return (TSR) relative to a global healthcare peer 
group of 14 other companies, over rolling three-year per-
formance periods. Only ECN members, as from perfor-
mance cycle 2023, are subject to the TSR performance 
metric under the LTPP.
TSR for Novartis and the peer companies is calcu-
lated as the change in the company share price, which 
is translated to USD at the relevant exchange rate, includ-
ing the reinvestment return of dividends, over the three-
year performance period. The calculation is based on 
Bloomberg standard published TSR data, which is pub-
licly available. The position of Novartis in the peer group 
determines the payout range based on a payout matrix. 
Other share awards
Selected employees may exceptionally receive Special 
Share Awards of RSs or RSUs. These Special Share 
Awards provide an opportunity to reward outstanding 
achievements or exceptional performance, and aim to 
retain key contributors. They are based on a formal inter-
nal selection process, through which the individual per-
formance of each selected employee is assessed at sev-
eral management levels. Special Share Awards had a 
minimum three-year vesting period before 2021 and 
mainly three years thereafter. In exceptional circum-
stances, Special Share Awards may be awarded to 
attract special expertise and new talents to the 
­organization (not applicable to ECN). Externally recruited 
ECN members are eligible only for special awards that 
are “buyouts” in the case that it is to replace equity for-
feited with their former employer. The equity is provided 
on a like-for-like basis as the forfeited equity, at a similar 
value with a similar vesting period, and with or without a 
performance condition.
Worldwide, employees at different levels in the orga-
nization were awarded RSs and RSUs in 2024, 2023 and 
2022.
In addition, in 2024, 2023 and 2022, Board members 
received ­unrestricted shares as part of their regular com-
pensation.
Summary of share grants
The table below provides a summary of share grants (shares, RSs, RSUs and PSUs) for all plans. At the Sandoz 
Distribution date, all RSU and PSU holders, who were not entitled to the dividend in kind in the form of Sandoz Group 
AG shares received “keep whole awards” in Novartis AG shares to compensate for the loss of the Sandoz value 
from their Novartis AG shares. These keep whole awards were accounted for as a modification, which did not sig-
nificantly change the fair value of the original grant. The change in fair value was measured by comparing the fair 
value of the grant before the spin-off against the fair value of the grant plus keep whole award right after spin-off.

 26. Transactions with related parties
Novartis Pension Fund
In 2018, a Company subsidiary provided an uncommit-
ted overnight credit facility to the Novartis Pension Fund, 
Switzerland, for up to USD 500 million with interest at 
the US Federal Funds Rate. This credit facility was not 
utilized during the current and past years.
Executive Officers and Non-Executive Directors compensation
As at December 31, 2024, there were 11 Executive 
­Committee ­members (“Executive Officers”). During 
2024, no Executive Officer stepped down. 
As at December 31, 2023, there were 11 Executive 
Officers. During 2023, 1 Executive Officer stepped 
down. 
As at December 31, 2022, there were 11 Executive 
Officers. During 2022, 5 Executive Officers stepped 
down.
The total compensation for Executive Committee members and the 13 Non-Executive Directors (14 in 2023 and 15 
in 2022) using the Company’s accounting policies for equity-based compensation and pension benefits was as fol-
lows:

During 2024, there was a slight increase in the compen-
sation expense for Executive Officers compared to 
2023, mainly as a result of higher cash and other com-
pensation paid for current Executive Officers.
During 2023, there was an increase in the IFRS 
Accounting Standards compensation expense for Exec-
utive Officers compared with 2022, primarily driven by 
higher equity-based compensation, mainly due to higher 
realized and expected payouts on the achievement of 
the defined performance criteria, partly offset by lower 
cash and other compensation, due to lower accelerated 
expenses from stepped down Executive Officers com-
pared with 2022.
The Annual Incentive award, which is fully included 
in equity-based compensation even when paid out in 
cash, is granted in January in the year following the 
reporting period.
The disclosures on Board and executive compensa-
tion required by the Swiss Code of Obligations are shown 
in the Compensation Report of the Company.
27. Commitments and contingent liabilities
Research and development 
commitments
The Company has entered into long-term research and 
development agreements with various institutions related 
to intangible assets. These agreements provide for 
potential milestone payments by Novartis, which are 
dependent on successful clinical development, or meet-
ing specified sales targets, or other conditions that are 
specified in the agreements.

Commitments for capital calls
The Company holds investments in funds in which it has 
committed to invest further upon future capital calls. As 
at December 31, 2024, the total uncalled capital commit-
ments for the Company’s investments in funds amount 
to USD 63 million. Note 28 contains further information 
on the Company’s investments in funds.
Other commitments
The Company has entered into various purchase com-
mitments for services and materials as well as for equip-
ment in the ordinary course of business. These commit-
ments are generally entered into at current market prices 
and reflect normal business operations. For the disclo-
sure of property, plant and equipment purchase commit-
ments, see Note 9. The Company routinely acquires 
interests in intellectual property focused on key disease 
areas and indications that the Company expects to be 
growth drivers in the future. The Company has a com-
mitment related to a long-term research and develop-
ment agreement that was entered into in the fourth quar-
ter in 2024 that closed on January 11, 2025 totaling USD 
1.9 billion, of which USD 1.0 billion was paid on January 
17, 2025.
Guarantees issued
The Company has issued guarantees to third parties in 
the ordinary course of business, including for tax, cus-
toms or other governmental agencies. 
Contingent liabilities
Novartis companies have to observe the laws, govern-
ment orders and regulations of the country in which they 
operate.
A number of Novartis companies are, and will likely 
continue to be, subject to various legal proceedings and 
investigations that arise from time to time, including pro-
ceedings pertaining to: pricing; bribery and corruption; 
trade regulation and embargo legislation; product 
liability; commercial disputes; employment and wrongful 
discharge; antitrust and competition; securities; govern-
ment benefit programs; reimbursement; rebates; health-
care fraud; sales and marketing practices; insider trad-
ing; occupational health and safety; environmental 
regulations; tax; cyber and data security; use of technol-
ogies, including AI; data privacy; regulatory interactions; 
disclosure compliance; and intellectual property. As a 
result, the Company may become subject to substantial 
liabilities that may not be covered by insurance and that 
could affect our business, financial position and reputa-
tion. While Novartis does not believe that any of these 
legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on 
its financial position, litigation is inherently unpredictable 
and large judgments sometimes occur. Consequently, 
we may in the future incur judgments that could involve 
large payments, including the potential repayment of 
amounts allegedly obtained improperly, and other pen-
alties, including treble damages, any of which could have 
a material adverse effect on our results of operations or 
cash flow.
Governments and regulatory authorities around the 
world have been stepping up their compliance and law 
enforcement activities in recent years in key areas, 
including marketing practices, pricing, corruption, trade 
restrictions, embargo legislation, insider trading, anti-
trust, cyber security and data privacy. Furthermore, when 
a government or regulatory authority undertakes an 
investigation, it is not uncommon for other governments 
or regulators to undertake investigations regarding the 
same or similar matters. Responding to such investiga-
tions is costly and requires an increasing amount of man-
agement’s time and attention. In addition, such investi-
gations may affect our reputation, create a risk of 
potential exclusion from government reimbursement 
programs in the United States and other countries, and 
lead to (or arise from) litigation. These factors have con-
tributed to decisions by Novartis and other ­co­mpanies 
in the healthcare industry, when deemed in their interest, 
to enter into settlement agreements with governmental 
authorities around the world prior to any formal decision 
by the authorities or a court. These government settle-
ments have involved and may in the future involve large 
cash payments, sometimes in the hundreds of millions 
of dollars or more, including the potential repayment of 
amounts allegedly obtained improperly and other pen-
alties, including treble damages. In addition, settlements 
of government healthcare fraud cases and antitrust 
cases often require companies to enter into corporate 
integrity agreements (or other similar types of agree-
ments), which are intended to regulate company behav-
ior for a period of years. Our affiliate Novartis Corpora-
tion is party to such an agreement, which will expire in 
2025. In addition, matters underlying governmental 
investigations and settlements may be the subject of 
separate private litigation.
While provisions have been made for probable out-
flows of economic resources, which management deems 
to be ­reasonable or appropriate, there are uncertainties 
connected with these ­estimates.
Note 20 contains additional information on these 
matters.
A number of Novartis companies are involved in legal 
proceedings concerning intellectual property rights. The

F-61
inherent unpredictability of such proceedings means 
that there can be no assurances as to their ultimate out-
come. A negative result in any such proceeding could 
potentially adversely affect the ability of certain Novartis 
companies to sell their products, or require the payment 
of substantial damages or royalties. The timing and the 
outcome of legal proceedings and their potential finan-
cial effect are not predictable.
In the opinion of management, however, the outcome 
of these actions will not materially affect the Company’s 
financial position but could be material to the results of 
operations or cash flow in a given period.
The Company’s potential environmental remediation 
liability is assessed based on a risk assessment and 
investigation of the various sites identified by the Com-
pany as at risk for environmental remediation exposure. 
The Company’s future remediation expenses are affected 
by a number of uncertainties. These uncertainties 
include, but are not limited to, the method and extent of 
remediation, the percentage of material attributable to 
the Company at the remediation sites relative to that 
attributable to other parties, and the financial capabili-
ties of the other potentially responsible parties.
Note 20 contains additional information on environ-
mental liabilities.

Fair value by hierarchy
As required by the IFRS Accounting Standards, financial 
assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consol-
idated financial statements are categorized based upon 
the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to 
measure their fair value. There are three hierarchical lev-
els, based on increasing ­subjectivity associated with the 
inputs to derive fair valuation for these assets and liabil-
ities, which are as follows:
The assets carried at Level 1 fair value are equity and 
debt securities as well as fund investments listed in active 
markets.
The assets generally included in the Level 2 fair value 
hierarchy are derivatives, and certain debt securities. The 
liabilities generally included in this fair value hierarchy 
consist of derivatives. These are valued using corrobo-
rated market data.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable for the asset or lia-
bility. The assets generally included in Level 3 fair value 
hierarchy are various investments in funds and unquoted 
equity security investments. Contingent consideration 
and other financial liabilities carried at fair value are 
included in this category.

1	 Represents the carrying values associated with Level 3 financial instruments at January 1, 2023, related to the Sandoz business reported as discontinued operations. Notes 1, 2 
and 29 provide disclosures related to discontinued operations.
During 2024, there were two transfers of equity securi-
ties from Level 3 to Level 1 for USD 19 million (2023: 
USD 63 million), due to the Initial Public Offering of the 
invested company or lift of certain restrictions. 
Realized gains and losses associated with Level 3 
long-term financial investments measured at fair value 
through the consolidated income statement are recorded 
in the consolidated income statement under “Other 
income” or “Other expense,” respectively. Realized gains 
and losses associated with Level 3 long-term financial 
investments measured at fair value through other com-
prehensive income are not recycled through the consol-
idated income statement but are instead reclassified to 
retained earnings.
During the year, the net gain and net loss recorded 
on associated companies, fund investments and long-
term financial investments at fair value through profit and 
loss were USD 91 million and USD 136 million, respec-
tively.
To determine the fair value of a contingent 
­consideration, various unobservable inputs are used. A 
change in these inputs might result in a significantly 
higher or lower fair value measurement. The inputs used 
are, among others, the probability of success, sales fore-
cast, assumptions regarding the discount rate and tim-
ing, and different scenarios of triggering events. The 
inputs are ­interrelated. The significance and usage of 
these inputs to each contingent consideration may vary 
due to differences in the timing and triggering events for 
payments or in the nature of the asset related to the con-
tingent consideration. 
If the most significant parameters for the Level 3 input 
were to change by 10% positively or negatively, or where 
the probability of success (POS) is the most significant 
input parameter, 10% were added or deducted from the 
applied probability of success, for contingent consider-
ation payables and contingent consideration receivables, 
this would change the amounts recorded in the 2024 
consolidated income statement by USD 141 million and 
USD 135 million, respectively.
Equity securities measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive 
income
Equity securities held as strategic investments, typically 
held outside the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally 
designated at date of acquisition as financial assets val-
ued at fair value through other comprehensive income 
with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss. 
Except for the investment in Sandoz Group AG with a 
fair value of USD 595 million as at December 31, 2023, 
these are made up of individually non-significant invest-
ments. In 2024, the consolidated foundations’ invest-
ments in Sandoz Group AG shares were fully sold, and 
the USD 169 million gain on disposal was transferred 
from other comprehensive income to retained earnings. 
As at December 31, 2024, the Company holds 52 non-
listed equity securities (December 31, 2023: 61) and 16 
listed equity securities (December 31, 2023: 28) in this 
category with the following fair values:

During 2024 and 2023, dividends received from these 
equity securities were insignificant. In 2024, equity secu-
rities that were no longer considered strategic, with a 
fair value of USD 95 million (2023: USD 279 million), were 
sold, and the USD 70 million loss on disposal net of taxes 
(2023: USD 1 million gain) was transferred from other

comprehensive income to retained earnings. In total, 
including the disposal of the Sandoz Group AG shares, 
a USD 81 million gain, net of taxes, was transferred from 
other comprehensive income to retained earnings (see 
Note 8).
Nature and extent of risks arising 
from financial instruments
Market risk
Market risk in general comprises currency risk, interest 
rate risk and price risk, such as commodity and equity 
prices. Novartis is exposed to market risk, primarily 
related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates 
and the market value of investments. The Company 
actively monitors and seeks to reduce, where it deems 
it appropriate to do so, fluctuations in these exposures. 
It is the Company’s policy and practice to enter into a 
variety of derivative financial instruments to manage the 
volatility of these exposures. It does not enter into any 
financial transactions containing a risk that cannot be 
quantified at the time the transaction is concluded. In 
addition, it does not sell short assets it does not have, or 
does not know it will have, in the future. The Company 
only sells existing assets or enters into transactions and 
future transactions (in the case of anticipatory hedges) 
that it confidently expects it will have in the future, based 
on past experience. 
Foreign currency exchange rate risk
The Company uses the US dollar as its reporting cur-
rency. As a result, the Company is exposed to foreign 
currency exchange movements, primarily in European, 
Japanese and emerging market currencies. Fluctuations 
in the exchange rates between the US dollar and other 
currencies can have a significant effect on both the Com-
pany’s results of operations, including reported sales and 
earnings, as well as on the reported value of our assets, 
liabilities and cash flows. This, in turn, may significantly 
affect the comparability of period-to-period results of 
operations.
Because our expenditures in Swiss francs are sig-
nificantly higher than our revenues in Swiss francs, vol-
atility in the value of the Swiss franc can have a signifi-
cant impact on the reported value of our earnings, assets 
and liabilities, and the timing and extent of such volatility 
can be difficult to predict.
There is also a risk that certain countries could expe-
rience a devaluation of their currency. If this occurs, it 
could impact the effective prices we would be able to 
charge for our products and also have an adverse impact 
on both our consolidated income statement and balance 
sheet.
Subsidiaries whose functional currencies have expe-
rienced a cumulative inflation rate of more than 100% 
over the past three years apply the principles of IAS Stan-
dards 29 “Financial reporting in Hyperinflationary Econ-
omies.” The hyperinflationary economies in which 
Novartis operates are Argentina, Venezuela and Turkey. 
Venezuela and Argentina were hyperinflationary for all 
periods presented, and Turkey became hyperinflation-
ary effective May 1, 2022, requiring retroactive imple-
mentation of hyperinflation accounting as of January 1, 
2022. The impacts of applying IAS Standards 29 are 
recorded in “Other financial income and expense” and 
are presented separately in Note 5 – Other financial 
income and expense.
The Company manages its global currency exposure 
by engaging in hedging transactions where management 
deems appropriate. Novartis may enter into various con-
tracts that reflect the changes in the value of foreign cur-
rency exchange rates to preserve the value of assets, 
commitments and anticipated transactions. Novartis also 
uses forward contracts and may enter into foreign cur-
rency option contracts to hedge.
Net investments in subsidiaries in foreign countries 
are long-term investments. Their fair value changes 
through movements of foreign currency exchange rates. 
The Company has designated a certain portion of its 
long-term euro-denominated straight bonds, maturing in 
2028, as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain 
of these net investments in foreign operations with euro 
functional currency. As of December 31, 2024, long-term 
financial debt with a carrying amount of EUR 1.8 billion 
(USD 1.9 billion; December 31, 2023: USD 2.0 billion), has 
been designated as a hedge instrument. During 2024, 
USD 91 million of net of taxes unrealized gains (2023: 
USD 50 million losses) was recognized in other compre-
hensive income and accumulated in currency translation 
effects in relation with this net investment hedge. The 
hedge remained effective since inception, and no amount 
was recognized in the consolidated income statement 
in 2024 and 2022. In 2023, USD 8 million of accumulated 
net investment hedge reserve was recognized in the con-
solidated income statement at the time of the Sandoz 
spin-off.
Commodity price risk
The Company has only a very limited exposure to price 
risk related to anticipated purchases of certain commod-
ities used as raw materials by the Company’s businesses. 
A change in those prices may alter the gross margin of 
a specific business, but generally by not more than 10% 
of the margin and thus below the Company’s risk man-
agement tolerance levels. Accordingly, the Company 
does not enter into significant commodity futures, for-
ward or option contracts to manage fluctuations in prices 
of anticipated purchases.
Interest rate risk
The Company addresses its net exposure to interest rate 
risk mainly through the ratio of its fixed-rate financial 
debt to variable-rate financial debt contained in its total 
financial debt portfolio. To manage this mix, Novartis may 
enter into interest rate swap agreements, in which it 
exchanges periodic ­payments based on a notional 
amount and agreed-upon fixed and variable interest 
rates.
Equity risk
The Company may purchase equities as investments of 
its liquid funds. As a policy, it limits its holdings in an unre-
lated company to less than 5% of its liquid funds. Poten-
tial investments are thoroughly analyzed. Call options 
are written on equities that the Company owns, and put 
options are written on equities that the Company wants 
to buy and for which cash is available.

Credit risk
Credit risks arise from the possibility that customers may 
not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To man-
age this risk, the Company periodically assesses coun-
try and customer credit risk, assigns individual credit lim-
its, and takes actions to mitigate credit risk where 
appropriate (for example payment guarantees, credit 
insurance and factoring).
The provisions for expected credit losses for cus-
tomers are based on a forward-looking expected credit 
loss, which includes possible default events on the trade 
receivables over the entire holding period of the trade 
receivables.
In measuring the expected credit losses, trade receiv-
ables are grouped based on shared credit risk charac-
teristics (such as private versus public receivables) and 
days past due. In determining the expected credit loss 
rates, the Company considers current and forward-look-
ing macroeconomic factors that may affect the ability of 
customers to settle the receivables, and historical loss 
rates for each category of customers.
The Company’s largest customer accounted for 
approximately 17% of net sales to third parties from con-
tinuing operations, and the second largest and third larg-
est customers accounted for 13% and 7% of net sales 
to third parties from continuing operations, respectively 
(2023: 15%, 13% and 8%, respectively; 2022: 16%, 12% 
and 8%, respectively).
The highest amounts of trade receivables outstand-
ing were for these same three customers and amounted 
to 19%, 12% and 7%, respectively, of the Company’s trade 
receivables as at December 31, 2024 (2023: 17%, 13% 
and 8%, respectively). There is no other significant con-
centration of customer credit risk.
Counterparty risk
Counterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable 
securities and money market instruments; credit risk on 
cash, time deposits and derivatives; as well as settlement 
risk for different instruments. Issuer risk is reduced by only 
buying securities that are at least A- rated. Counterparty 
credit risk and settlement risk are reduced by a policy of 
entering into transactions with counterparties (banks or 
financial institutions) that feature a strong credit rating. 
Exposure to these risks is closely monitored and kept 
within predetermined parameters. The limits are regularly 
assessed and determined based upon credit analysis, 
including financial statement and capital adequacy ratio 
reviews. In addition, reverse repurchasing agreements are 
contracted, and Novartis has entered into credit support 
agreements with various banks for derivative transactions. 
To further reduce the settlement risk, the Company has 
implemented a multi-currency payment system, Continu-
ous Linked Settlement (CLS), which provides multilateral 
netting (payment-versus-payment settlement) of cash 
flows from foreign exchange transactions.
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held 
with major regulated financial institutions, the three larg-
est of which hold approximately 9.6%, 7.9% and 7.7%, 
respectively (2023: 8.3%, 7.5% and 7.4%, respectively). 
The Company does not expect any losses from 
non-performance by these counterparties and does not 
have any significant grouping of exposures to financial 
sector or country risk.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company 
could not be able to settle or meet its obligations asso-
ciated with financial liabilities that are settled by deliver-
ing cash or another financial asset. Novartis Treasury is 
responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement manage-
ment. In addition, liquidity and funding risks, and related 
processes and policies, are overseen by management. 
Novartis manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated 
basis according to business needs and tax, capital or 
regulatory considerations, if applicable, through numer-
ous sources of financing in order to maintain flexibility. 
Certain countries have legal or economic restrictions 
on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Com-
pany in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances, 
but these restrictions do not have an impact on the abil-
ity of the Company to meet its cash obligations.
Management monitors the Company’s net debt or 
liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis 
of expected cash flows.
Novartis has a US commercial paper program under 
which it can issue up to USD 9.0 billion in the aggregate 
of unsecured commercial paper notes. Under this pro-
gram, commercial paper notes totaling USD 3.5 billion 
were outstanding as per December 31, 2024, (2023: USD 
3.0 billion) with a weighted average interest rate of 4.5% 
(2023: 5.4%). Novartis also has a Japanese commercial 
paper program under which it can issue up to JPY 150 
billion (approximately USD 1.0 billion) of unsecured com-
mercial paper notes. Under this program, commercial 
paper notes totaling USD 0.6 billion were outstanding as 
per December 31, 2024 (2023: USD 0.3 billion) with a 
weighted average interest rate of 0.5% (2023: 0.1%). 
Novartis further has a committed credit facility of USD 6.0 
billion. In May 2024, Novartis replaced its existing USD 
6.0 billion credit facility with a syndicate of banks (which 
was undrawn at its replacement date and December 31, 
2023, and had a maturity date of September 2025) with 
a new USD 6.0 billion credit facility with a syndicate of 
banks. This credit facility is intended to be used as a 
backstop for the US commercial paper program. This 
facility matures in May 2029, and was undrawn as at 
December 31, 2024.

Capital risk management
Novartis strives to maintain a strong credit rating. In man-
aging its capital, Novartis focuses on maintaining a 
strong balance sheet. As at December 31, 2024, Moody’s 
Ratings rated the Company Aa3 for long-term maturities 
and P-1 for short-term maturities, and S&P Global Rat-
ings rated the Company AA- for long-term maturities and 
A-1+ for short-term maturities. 
Sensitivity analysis
The Company uses sensitivity analysis disclosures to 
provide quantitative information about market risks to 
which it is exposed. 
The sensitivity analysis disclosures are in line with 
the Company’s financial risk management policy, and are 
based on a one-parameter risk model that considers a 
one-factor linear relationship between risk factors and 
exposures. They consider aggregated risk exposures 
arising from the most significant risk factors (currency 
risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk) and include

all financial assets and financial liabilities as set forth in 
the table on page F-61. 
The disclosures below illustrate the potential impact 
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as 
a result of hypothetical market movements in foreign cur-
rency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. 
The range of variables chosen reflects management’s 
view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-
year period. 
Foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity
The Company uses the US dollar as its reporting cur-
rency. As a result, the Company is exposed to foreign 
currency exchange movements, primarily in European, 
Japanese and emerging market currencies, as well as in 
the Swiss franc. A strengthening (weakening) of the US 
dollar against these currencies as at December 31, 2024 
and 2023 would have affected the measurement of finan-
cial instruments denominated in these foreign curren-
cies. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in 
particular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical 
5% increase or decrease in the foreign currency 
exchange rates against the US dollar would have 
impacted the Company’s consolidated income statement 
as presented below: 
(USD millions)

As of December 31, 2024, the Company designated EUR 
1.8 billion (December 31, 2023: EUR 1.8 billion) of its long-
term euro-denominated straight bonds as hedges of the 
translation risk arising on certain net investments in for-
eign operations with euro functional currency. This anal-
ysis assumes that all other variables, in particular inter-
est rates, remain constant. A hypothetical 5% increase, 
or decrease, in the foreign currency exchange rates 
against the US dollar, without considering the translation 
effect of these net investments, would have impacted 
the Company’s consolidated equity as presented below:

– 102	
Interest rate sensitivity
Our portfolio of fixed-income instruments as at Decem-
ber 31, 2024, was mainly composed of time deposits and 
debt securities. 
Novartis uses duration models to approximate the 
possible change in the value of fixed-income instru-
ments. Based on these models, management believes 
that a 100-basis point change in interest is deemed a 
reasonable possible change over a one-year period.
Based on exposures in 2024 and 2023, a hypothet-
ical 100-basis point increase (decrease) in interest rates 
would not have resulted in a significant increase 
(decrease) in the fair values of the fixed-income instru-
ments nor in a significant increase (decrease) of cash 
flows attributable to such instruments.
The vast majority of our outstanding financial debts 
are straight bonds with fixed interest rates and are there-
fore not affected by movements in interest rates.
Equity price sensitivity
Fund investments and equity securities held by the 
Novartis Venture Fund are valued at fair value through 
profit and loss. Equity securities held as strategic invest-
ments, typically held outside the Novartis Venture Fund, 
are generally designated at date of acquisition as finan-
cial assets valued at fair value through other compre-
hensive income with no subsequent recycling through 
profit and loss.
The fair value of these fund investments and equity 
securities was USD 1.1 billion as at December 31, 2024 
(December 31, 2023: USD 1.8 billion). The fair values of 
these investments are impacted by the volatility of the 
stock market, valuation parameters applied (for non-
listed equities classified in Level 3 of the fair value hier-
archy) and changes in general economic factors. This 
analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular 
interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical increase 
or decrease of 15% in the risk factors would have 
impacted the Company’s consolidated income statement 
as presented below: 
(USD millions)

 29. Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations include the operational results 
from the Sandoz generic pharmaceuticals and biosimi-
lars division and certain corporate activities attributable 
to the Sandoz business, as well as certain other expenses 
related to the spin-off. Also included in 2023 is the IFRS 
Accounting Standards non-cash, non-taxable net gain 
on the distribution of Sandoz Group AG to Novartis AG 
shareholders (refer to Notes 1 and 2 for further details).
The Sandoz business operated in the off-patent 
medicines segment and specialized in the development, 
manufacturing, and marketing of generic pharmaceuticals 
and biosimilars. The Sandoz business was organized 
globally into two franchises: Generics and Biosimilars.

1	 The net income from discontinued operations for 2023 is for the period from January 1, 2023, to the October 3, 2023, Distribution date.
2	The tax rate in 2023 was impacted by non-recurring items such as tax benefits arising from intercompany transactions to effect the spin-off of the Sandoz business, net decreases 
in uncertain tax positions of the Sandoz business and the favorable settlement of a tax matter related to the Alcon business, which was spun-off in 2019. Excluding these impacts, 
the tax rate would have been 31.2% in 2023, compared with 24.1% % in 2022. The tax rate in 2023 is higher than 2022 primarily due to a change in profit mix between years.

Revenue
In addition to the elements of variable consideration 
listed in the revenue accounting policy described in Note 
1, the Sandoz business granted shelf stock adjustments 
to customers to cover the inventory held by them at the 
time a price decline becomes effective. Revenue deduc-
tion provisions for shelf stock adjustments were recorded 
when the price decline was anticipated, based on the 
impact of the price decline on the customer’s estimated 
inventory levels.

Net cash flows from financing activities from 
discontinued operations
In 2023, the net cash inflows from financing activities 
from discontinued operations of USD 3.3 billion (2022: 
USD 119 million) were mainly driven by USD 3.6 billion 
cash inflows from bank borrowings (including the USD 
3.3 billion Sandoz business borrowings from a group of 
banks on September 28, 2023) in connection with the 
Distribution (spin-off) of the Sandoz business to Novartis 
AG shareholders, partly offset by transaction cost pay-
ments of USD 0.2 billion (2022: nil) directly attributable 
to the Distribution (spin-off) of the Sandoz business (see 
Notes 1 and 2). 
For additional information related to the October 3, 2023 
Distribution (spin-off) of the Sandoz business to Novartis 
AG shareholders, effected through a dividend in kind dis-
tribution of Sandoz Group AG shares to Novartis AG 
shareholders and ADR holders, refer to Note 1 and Note 
2.

Statutory Auditor’s Report
﻿
F-77
Statutory Auditor’s Report
To the General Meeting of Novartis AG, Basel 
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of 
Novartis AG and its subsidiaries (the Company), which com-
prise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 
2024, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity and the consolidated state-
ment of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to 
the consolidated financial statements, including material 
accounting policy information.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements 
(pages F-1 to F-76) give a true and fair view of the consoli-
dated financial position of the Company as at December 31, 
2024, and of its consolidated financial performance and its 
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accor-
dance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) Accounting Standards as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and comply with Swiss 
law.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, Inter-
national Standards on Auditing (ISA) and Swiss Standards 
on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under those pro-
visions and standards are further described in the “Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements” section of our report. We are independent of 
the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss 
law, together with the requirements of the Swiss audit pro-
fession, as well as those of the International Ethics Stan-
dards Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants (including International Inde-
pendence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
•	 Assessment of the recoverable amount for the Leqvio 
intangible asset
•	 Provisions for deductions from revenue related to US Man-
aged Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate programs
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the con-
solidated financial statements of the current period. These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in form-
ing our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
Assessment of the recoverable amount for the 
Leqvio intangible asset
Key Audit Matter
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial state-
ments, the Company determined the recoverable amount 
of the intangible assets other than goodwill based on the 
fair value less costs of disposal method for which no directly 
observable market inputs were available. As discussed in 
Note 11, the Company has intangible assets other than good-
will totaling USD 26 915 million as of December 31, 2024, of 
which USD 6.3 billion related to the currently marketed prod-
uct Leqvio.
We identified the assessment of the recoverable amount, 
specifically the sales forecasts, of the Leqvio intangible 
asset, as a key audit matter. Significant auditor judgment 
and subjectivity was required to assess the sales forecasts 
assumptions due to the high degree of subjectivity and esti-
mation uncertainty involved. These sales forecasts assump-
tions were a significant input in the determination of the 
recoverable amount of the Leqvio intangible asset.
Our response
The following are the primary procedures we performed to 
address this key audit matter:
•	 We evaluated the design and tested the operating effec-
tiveness of a certain internal control related to the Com-
pany’s intangible asset impairment process for Leqvio, 
including the development of the sales forecasts;
•	 We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s sales 
forecasts for Leqvio by (1) comparing the sales forecasts 
assumptions to company-specific operational information 
and management’s communications to the Board of Direc-
tors, (2) comparing the most recent sales performance to 
previous drug launches, and (3) comparing the sales fore-
casts assumptions to available external market and indus-
try data; and
•	 We assessed management’s ability to accurately forecast 
sales by comparing historical sales forecasts for Leqvio 
to actual results.
For further information on the assessment of the recover-
able amount for the Leqvio intangible asset refer to the 
­following:
•	 Page F-6 (Note 1 Accounting policies);
•	 Page F-18 (Note 4 Revenues and geographic information); 
and
•	 Page F-32 (Note 11 Goodwill and intangible assets other 
than goodwill).

Provisions for deductions from revenue related to 
US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid 
rebate programs
Key Audit Matter
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial state-
ments, the Company records provisions for estimated 
rebates as a deduction from revenue when the related rev-
enue is recognized. Rebates involve the use of assumptions 
and judgments in the determination of the provision rates 
at the time revenues are recorded. Provision rates are influ-
enced by the terms and conditions in the individual agree-
ments, historical experience, product sales and growth rate, 
population growth, product pricing, the mix of contracts and 
products, the level of inventory in the distribution channel, 
regulations, channels and payers. As discussed in Note 22, 
provisions for deductions from revenue totaled USD 7 004 
million as of December 31, 2024, a portion of which related 
to US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate 
programs (hereafter “US rebates”). We identified the eval-
uation of the US rebates provisions as a key audit matter. 
The evaluation of the rebate provision rates required a high 
degree of subjective auditor judgment as it involved esti-
mating the portion of the Company’s consolidated revenue 
which will ultimately be subject to a related rebate.
Our response
The following are the primary procedures we performed to 
address this key audit matter:
•	 We evaluated the design and tested the operating effec-
tiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s 
US rebates process related to the development of the 
rebate provision rates;
•	 We developed our own independent expectation of the 
US rebates provisions, by using internal and external infor-
mation, including historical experience and trend analysis 
of actual rebate claims paid, and comparing it to manage-
ment’s actual recorded balances; and
•	 We assessed management’s ability to accurately estimate 
the US rebates provisions by comparing historically 
recorded provisions to the actual amount that was ulti-
mately paid by the Company.
For further information on provisions for deductions from 
revenue related to US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and 
Medicaid rebate programs refer to the following:
•	 Page F-6 (Note 1 Accounting policies);
•	 Page F-18 (Note 4 Revenue and geographic information);
•	 Page F-37 (Note 15 Trade receivables); and
•	 Page F-47 (Note 22 Provisions and other current liabili-
ties).
Other Information in the 
Annual Report
The Board of Directors is responsible for the other informa-
tion in the Annual Report. The other information comprises 
the information included in the annual report, but does not 
include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-
alone financial statements of the company, the compensa-
tion report and our auditor’s reports thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements 
does not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated finan-
cial statements, our responsibility is to read the other infor-
mation and, in doing so, consider whether the other infor-
mation is materially inconsistent with the consolidated 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit 
or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other informa-
tion, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report in this regard.
Board of Directors’ Responsibilities 
for the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements, which give a true 
and fair view in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards 
and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal con-
trol as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Com-
pany’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of 
Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do 
so.

F-79
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accor-
dance with Swiss law, ISA and SA-CH will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, indi-
vidually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial state-
ments.
As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law, ISA 
and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and main-
tain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the consolidated financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opin-
ion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control.
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the 
audit in order to design audit procedures that are appro-
priate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Com-
pany’s internal control.
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made. 
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Direc-
tors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to con-
tinue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in 
our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the con-
solidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are 
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going 
concern. 
•	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the consolidated financial statements, including the dis-
closures, and whether the consolidated financial state-
ments represent the underlying transactions and events 
in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•	 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business units within 
the Company as a basis for forming an opinion on the con-
solidated financial statements. We are responsible for the 
direction, supervision and review of the audit work per-
formed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Board of Directors, primarily 
through the Audit and Compliance Committee regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our 
audit.
We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement 
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be 
thought to bear on our independence, and where applica-
ble, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated to the Board of Direc-
tors and the Audit and Compliance Committee, we deter-
mine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current 
period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report, unless law or regula-
tion precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a mat-
ter should not be communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.
Report on Other Legal and 
Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with Art. 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and PS-CH 
890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which 
has been designed for the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements according to the instructions of the 
Board of Directors.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements 
submitted to you be approved.

Notes to the financial statements 
of Novartis AG
1. Introduction
The financial statements of Novartis AG, with its regis-
tered office in Basel, comply with the requirements of 
the Swiss accounting legislation of the Swiss Code of 
Obligations (SCO).
Novartis AG is presenting consolidated financial 
statements according to IFRS Accounting Standards. 
Novartis AG has therefore applied the exemption 
included in article 961d, paragraph 1 SCO, and has not 
prepared additional disclosures, a separate cash flow 
statement or a management report for SCO purposes.
Declaration of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees
Novartis AG does not have employees.
Significant transactions in 2024
On June 18, 2024, Novartis AG issued five new bonds 
totaling CHF 2.2 billion (see Note 9).
Significant transactions in 2023
The Novartis AG shareholders approved the spin-off of 
the Sandoz business at the Extraordinary General Meet-
ing (EGM) held on September 15, 2023, subject to the 
completion of certain conditions precedent to the Dis-
tribution.
The conditions precedent to the spin-off were met, 
and on October 3, 2023, the spin-off of the Sandoz busi-
ness was effected by way of a distribution of a dividend 
in kind of Sandoz Group AG shares to Novartis AG share-
holders and American Depositary Receipt (ADR) hold-
ers (“the Distribution”).
Through the Distribution each Novartis AG share-
holder received 1 Sandoz Group AG share for every 5 
Novartis AG shares and each Novartis ADR holder 
received 1 Sandoz ADR for every 5 Novartis ADR that 
they held on October 3, 2023, close of business. 
As of October 4, 2023, the shares of Sandoz Group 
AG have been listed on the Swiss Exchange (SIX) under 
the stock symbol “SDZ”.
At the date of the Distribution, the book value of 
Sandoz Group AG was CHF 4 769 million and consisted 
of investments in direct and indirect Sandoz subsidiar-
ies (CHF 2 781 million) and cash (CHF 1 988 million). The 
Distribution was made at the book value of Sandoz Group 
AG and was recognized as a reduction to available earn-
ings brought forward (CHF 4 769 million).
2. Accounting policies
Financial income and expenses
Current assets and current liabilities denominated in for-
eign currencies are converted at year-end exchange 
rates. Realized exchange gains and losses, and all unre-
alized exchange losses arising from these as well as 
those from business transactions, are recorded net as 
financial income or financial expenses.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used for hedging pur-
poses. These instruments are valued at fair value. When 
different accounting policies apply for the hedged item 
and the derivative financial instrument, hedge account-
ing is applied through measuring the hedged item 
together with the derivative financial instrument. Deriv-
ative financial instruments are included in other current 
receivables and other current liabilities with direct and 
indirect subsidiaries.
Financial assets
Financial assets are valued at acquisition cost less 
adjustments for foreign currency losses and any other 
impairment of value.
Investments
Investments are initially recognized at cost. Investments 
in Novartis AG direct and indirect subsidiaries are 
assessed annually and, in case of an impairment, adjusted 
to their recoverable amount within their category.
Goodwill
Goodwill is capitalized and amortized over a period of 
20 years. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an 
annual basis. If necessary, an impairment loss is recog-
nized.
Bonds
Bonds are valued at nominal value. Any bond premium 
is accrued over the duration of the bond so that at matu-
rity, the balance sheet amount will equal the amount that 
is due to be paid.
Provisions
Provisions are made to cover general business risks of 
Novartis AG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.

3. Other income
The French Competition Authority (FCA) conducted an investigation into Lucentis against several Novartis subsid-
iaries. In 2020, Novartis AG was jointly held liable for a fine of EUR 308 million. As Lucentis is commercialized by 
Novartis subsidiaries, rather than by Novartis AG itself, Novartis AG was fully reimbursed by the operational sub-
sidiary. In 2023, this decision was reformed and the fine of EUR 308 million (CHF 308 million) was reimbursed to 
Novartis AG. As a result, Novartis AG reimbursed the full amount to the operational subsidiary. These amounts are 
shown net in the income statement in 2023.

7. Interest-bearing current receivables and liabilities 
and financial assets with direct and indirect 
subsidiaries
Interest-bearing current receivables and liabilities with Novartis AG direct and indirect subsidiaries contain intra-
group arrangements under which Novartis AG grants or receives credits that are available on demand.
Financial assets with Novartis AG direct and indirect subsidiaries include financing arrangements and loans to 
direct or indirect subsidiaries.
8. Investments in direct and indirect subsidiaries
The principal direct and indirect subsidiaries and other holdings of Novartis AG are shown in Note 31 to Novartis 
AG and its subsidiaries’ 2024 consolidated financial statements prepared according to IFRS Accounting Standards.
In 2023, various participations in Novartis AG direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Sandoz-related partic-
ipations, were distributed by subsidiaries to Novartis AG, which in turn contributed these subsidiaries to Sandoz 
Group AG. The participation in Sandoz Group AG was distributed as a dividend in kind to Novartis AG sharehold-
ers and American Depositary Receipt (ADR) holders on October 3, 2023. As of October 4, 2023, the shares of 
Sandoz Group AG have been listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX) under the stock symbol “SDZ” (see Note 1).

Novartis AG share capital consisted of registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.49 each.
The total share capital decreased from CHF 1 116 million at December 31, 2023, to CHF 1 073 million at Decem-
ber 31, 2024, due to a share capital reduction as a result of the cancellation of 88 million repurchased shares with 
a nominal value of CHF 43 million. The cancellation of the 88 million shares was approved at the Annual General 
Meeting on March 5, 2024. 
During 2023, the total share capital decreased from CHF 1 202 million at December 31, 2022, to CHF 1 116 mil-
lion at December 31, 2023, due to a share capital reduction as a result of the cancellation of 126 million repurchased 
shares with a nominal value of CHF 63 million, and the reduction of the nominal value of Novartis AG shares by CHF 
0.01 which amounted to CHF 23 million.
In 2023, in connection with the Distribution (spin-off) of the Sandoz business (see Note 1), Novartis AG share-
holders approved a decrease of CHF 23 million in the share capital of Novartis AG at the EGM held on September 
15, 2023. The capital decrease resulted in a reduction on September 21, 2023, of the nominal value of the Novartis 
AG shares of CHF 0.01, from CHF 0.50 per share to CHF 0.49 per share.

Novartis AG has met the legal requirements for legal reserves under articles 659 SCO et. seq. for the treasury 
shares.
Treasury share purchases during 2024 totaled 79 million (2023: 89 million), with an average purchase price of 
CHF 94 (2023: CHF 86). No treasury shares were sold during 2024 and 2023. Share-based compensation trans-
actions totaled 10 million shares (2023: 11 million shares).
The number of treasury shares held by Novartis AG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries meet the definitions 
and requirements of article 659b SCO. As at December 31, 2024, treasury shares held by Novartis AG and its direct 
and indirect fully-owned subsidiaries totaled 213 030 042. It should be noted that within the Novartis AG consoli-
dated financial statements prepared according to IFRS Accounting Standards, some Novartis entities are included 
in the consolidation scope.
With the effective date of January 1, 2023, article 659b SCO was amended to change the definition of subsid-
iaries to include foundations of Novartis. This change was implemented as at January 1, 2023, and increased the 
Novartis AG reported number of treasury shares held by subsidiaries by 96 969 226 shares in 2023, to reflect the 
Novartis AG shares held by Novartis foundations.
As of the entry into force of the revised Swiss corporate law on January 1, 2023, Novartis ordinary shares held 
by Swiss foundations controlled by Novartis no longer carry the right to vote and are therefore included as trea-
sury shares for determining compliance with the legal requirements for legal reserves under SCO articles 659 et. 
seq. for treasury shares.
For more information related to the amendment to SCO article 659b (see Note 12).

Novartis AG is part of the Swiss Novartis value-added tax (VAT) group and is therefore jointly liable for existing and 
future VAT claims from the Swiss Federal Tax Administration.
In December 2021, Novartis AG entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repur-
chase Novartis shares on the second trading line under its up-to USD 15.0 billion share buyback. The arrangement 
was updated in July 2022, December 2022 and May 2023, and concluded in June 2023. 
In June 2023, Novartis AG entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repur-
chase 11.7 million Novartis shares on the second trading line, which concluded in July 2023.
In July 2023, Novartis AG entered into a new irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a bank to repur-
chase Novartis shares on the second trading line under its new up-to USD 15.0 billion share buyback.
In June 2024, Novartis AG amended the arrangement to include the repurchase of additional 8.7 million Novartis 
shares on the second trading line to mitigate the impact of share deliveries under the equity-based compensation 
plans for employees. These additional repurchases concluded in October 2024. Novartis AG was able to cancel 
this arrangement at any time but could have been subject to a 90-day waiting period under certain conditions. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, these waiting period conditions were not applicable and as a result, there 
was no requirement to record a contingent liability under this arrangement as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Statutory Auditor’s Report

Statutory Auditor’s Report
To the General Meeting of Novartis AG, Basel 
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Novartis AG 
(the Company), which comprise the balance sheet as at 
December 31, 2024, and the income statement for the 
year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the financial statements (A-1 to A-10) 
comply with Swiss law and the Company’s articles of 
incorporation.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law 
and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our respon-
sibilities under those provisions and standards are fur-
ther described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Financial Statements” section of our report. 
We are independent of the Company in accordance with 
the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the 
Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these require-
ments.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our profes-
sional judgment, were of most significance in our audit 
of the financial statements of the current period. We have 
determined that there are no key audit matters to com-
municate in our report.
Other Information in the Annual 
Report 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the other infor-
mation. The other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report, but does not include the 
consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone finan-
cial statements of the Company, the compensation 
report and our auditor’s reports thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial state-
ments, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information 
is materially inconsistent with the financial statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we con-
clude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard.
Board of Directors’ Responsibilities 
for the Financial Statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the prepara-
tion of the financial statements in accordance with the 
provisions of Swiss law and the Company’s articles of 
incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board 
of Directors determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of 
Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board 
of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or 
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to 
do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, indi-
vidually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Statutory Auditor’s Report
﻿
A-12
As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and 
SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
•	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 
of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive 
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suffi-
cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opin-
ion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the over-
ride of internal control.
•	 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the pur-
pose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the Company’s internal control.
•	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made. 
•	 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of 
Directors’ use of the going concern basis of account-
ing and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether 
a material uncertainty exists related to events or con-
ditions that may cast significant doubt on the Compa-
ny’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we con-
clude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the financial statements or, if such dis-
closures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease 
to continue as a going concern. 
We communicate with the Board of Directors or its rel-
evant committee regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant 
committee with a statement that we have complied with 
relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, 
and communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, actions taken to 
eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated to the Board of 
Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and are there-
fore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report, unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected 
to outweigh the public interest benefits of such commu-
nication.
Report on Other Legal and 
Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and 
PS-CH 890, we confirm that an internal control system 
exists, which has been designed for the preparation of 
the financial statements according to the instructions of 
the Board of Directors.
Based on our audit in accordance with Art. 728a para. 
1 item 2 CO, we confirm that the proposal of the Board 
of Directors complies with Swiss law and the Company’s 
articles of incorporation. We recommend that the finan-
cial statements submitted to you be approved.
