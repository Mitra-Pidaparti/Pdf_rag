The performance validates our strategy and gives us confidence that we are well prepared to grow by focusing on our key therapeutic areas and technology platforms. The strategic shift from a diversified life sciences company to a focused medicines organization over the last decade has proven to be the right path forward. With the divestment of our non-core activities in animal health, vaccines, and generics, among others, we were able to free up resources and strengthen our position in fast-growing and highly innovative medical fields such as xRNA, radioligand therapy, and gene and cell therapy. Our recent breakthroughs in breast cancer and kidney and blood diseases demonstrate that our operational focus strengthens our ability to deliver high-value medicines that alleviate society's greatest disease burdens. As we continue to accelerate our research and development efforts and strengthen our commercial capabilities, we expect to continue to grow profitably in the long-term and create sustainable shareholder value. Our efforts to more efficiently align our Research, Development, and Commercial organizations advanced further. Besides strategic acquisitions to increase our technological capacity and broaden our pipeline, we integrated artificial intelligence more deeply into our day-to-day operations to more efficiently assess new molecules and accelerate drug development timelines. In view of continuing geopolitical and economic volatility, we are further strengthening our global production and distribution network to withstand potential supply chain disruptions and improve overall resilience. We will stay disciplined in managing our technical and data infrastructure as well as our partner networks and build an agile footprint to quickly adapt to the changing environment.

The ERM process continued to evolve in 2024. The Corporate ERC team conducted risk workshops and collaborated with all risk assurance and monitoring functions to identify key risks across the Company. Each Novartis unit organized a focused risk workshop including leadership team members. In parallel, risk workshops were held in top countries by revenue and in certain focus markets. Once key risks were identified, mitigation action plans were created to address them in an effective way. The findings from these workshops were consolidated into the Novartis Risk Radar, which enables senior management, the Executive Committee and the Board to focus discussions on key risks and more closely align our corporate strategy with our risk exposure and ways of working.
In 2024, the Corporate ERC team further developed the ERM framework within the Novartis Corporate ERC organization. We developed additional risk management training and launched our risk intelligence forum, an event that brought together internal and external speakers to address emerging trends and threats. We also integrated a critical scope of activities (Trade Sanctions Governance) into the Corporate ERC team.

Looking ahead, I'm confident we'll see sales growth average at least 5% annually over the five years to 2029, and reach 40% core operating income margin by 2027! We're proud of our record and excited about the future. I want to offer a special note of thanks to outgoing Board Chair Joerg Reinhardt, who steps down after decades of leadership at Novartis. His impact will carry forward, and I'm grateful for his years of mentorship. In recent years, we've narrowed our focus, expanded our reach, and invested in the future.

We reached nearly 300 million patients with our innovative therapies - more than ever before - as we built on the momentum from our successful transformation. We consistently delivered strong financial and operational performance, significant R\&D achievements, and sustainable growth, and are well positioned to increase value for shareholders and society moving forward. Core to our approach is a relentless focus on innovation. It allowed us to develop and expand access to new treatments in our key therapeutic areas and technology platforms. In oncology, we built on the legacy of our work in areas like breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia with Kisqali and Scemblix, medicines developed by researchers in Novartis labs - a testament to the strength of our R\&D engine. We secured our spot as a global leader in radioligand therapy (RLT), a platform we believe has the potential to transform cancer care. Pluvicto, our RLT therapy for advanced prostate cancer, showed strength in the US and Europe. We are exploring new referral pathways and investing in RLT manufacturing to broaden its global availability. Our investments in cutting edge technology fueled innovation across therapeutic areas. We continue to prioritize platforms like RLT and RNA therapeutics, and increasingly integrate artificial intelligence and data science throughout our R\&D activities. These tools are helping uncover potential ways to accelerate drug design and clinical trial processes. Through a combination of in-house R\&D and targeted acquisitions and licensing agreements, we now have more than 30 potential new high-value medicines in our pipeline and expect more than 15 submission-enabling readouts over the next two years. We remain committed to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. We rank highly among industry peers in a range of key ESG ratings, and were honored to rank number one in the 2024 Access to Medicine Index. Fostering a culture of innovation depends on people. We aim to recruit, retain, and cultivate the best talent in the world.

|  Risk | Context | Mitigation measures  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Strategic risks |  |   |
|  Pricing, reimbursement and access | Pressure on the pricing of our medicines has many sources, including increasing healthcare costs, funding restrictions, increasing pressure on intellectual property protections, and policy changes.

We believe this incentivizes health systems to focus on interventions that deliver the most effective, efficient and sustainable outcomes. We also work through industry associations to advocate for policies that support a sustainable ecosystem for innovative medicines. |
|  Alliances, acquisitions and integration | As part of our strategy, we may acquire and divest products or entire businesses and form strategic alliances and collaborations to strengthen our pipeline of new medicines and help sustain long-term growth. The market for biologics and new technology platforms within our core therapeutic areas is highly competitive and there is a risk we will miss out on opportunities or be unable to fully realize the strategic benefits of these transactions. | We have strengthened our internal organization to streamline and focus decision-making by creating a new Strategy \& Growth function, single business development teams, and leadership teams for each of our core therapeutic areas. We have also implemented a single framework for portfolio assessment and prioritization. |
|  Key products and commercial priorities | Delivering on our growth targets requires us to focus on priority brands and markets to support new launches and overcome potential barriers to the uptake of new medicines. This could be impacted by several factors, including (but not limited to) competitive pressures, changes in the prescribing habits of healthcare professionals, and slower than expected adoption after launch.

We concentrate resources on priority programs to maximize early-stage potential and ensure effective latestage execution. We also focus on life-cycle management by enhancing the evidence base for key brands. We increase our chances of discovering new medicines by collaborating with outside researchers and biotech companies. Our network consists of academic and industry alliances working on joint research and drug discovery.
- Embed operational excellence to deliver returns.

that Novartis has a Board that is performing well and improving, where Directors are highly engaged and have a good rapport, and where there is effective succession and rejuvenation in place. Feedback from management on the Board's evaluation showed that the Executive Committee welcomes the interactions with the Board and its members, as well as the balanced supportive/ challenging dynamics and rich discussions. The report made several recommendations for the Board's consideration, including preparing for the transition to a new Board Chair in 2025 and areas where the Board should focus its attention in the future.
