Nonetheless, virtually every step in getting those products to market is now information-intensive and therefore information-enabled:

• Research & development  
  – AI/ML models sift huge internal and external data sets (omics, high-throughput screening, imaging, EHRs) to identify new targets and optimize lead compounds.  
  – Cloud-based modeling, bio-informatics pipelines and electronic lab notebooks are core R&D tools.

• Clinical development  
  – Electronic data-capture, eSource, remote patient monitoring and real-world-evidence platforms generate, transmit and analyse terabytes of trial data.  
  – Digital biomarkers and decentralized/virtual-trial technology are used to accelerate recruitment and lower cost.

• Regulatory, quality and pharmacovigilance  
  – Submissions are assembled and submitted electronically (eCTD).  
  – Signal detection relies on advanced analytics applied to global safety databases.

• Manufacturing and supply chain  
  – Plants run on MES, SCADA and IoT sensor networks; predictive-maintenance and advanced-planning systems use real-time data feeds.  
  – Serialization/track-and-trace data are exchanged with wholesalers, pharmacies and authorities.

• Commercial and medical affairs  
  – Omnichannel engagement platforms, CRM and marketing-automation systems drive promotion.  
  – Medical-information portals, AI chatbots and field-force iPad apps deliver content to HCPs.  
  – Patient-support programs often include smartphone apps, wearables integration and analytics dashboards.

• Companion and stand-alone digital products  
  – Several drugs are paired with adherence apps or connected devices.  
  – Pilots are under way in digital therapeutics and algorithm-based dosing support.

• Corporate infrastructure  
  – Finance, HR and procurement run on integrated ERP and SaaS suites.  
  – A large part of the IT stack (including AI services) is outsourced to hyperscale cloud and specialized third-party providers.

Because of this heavy reliance on data and connected systems, the company lists “Cybersecurity breaches, data loss and catastrophic loss of IT systems” among its principal enterprise risks.  That disclosure implies that a material interruption of information systems would significantly disrupt R&D, manufacturing, and commercial supply—evidence that the organization’s products and services are highly information-enabled even though they are not themselves sold as information goods.

Overall assessment  
Information-based: limited (the firm does not sell data or software as its primary revenue stream).  
Information-enabled: very high (digital data and IT are critical enablers across the entire value chain; loss of those capabilities would materially affect operations and revenue).","In particular, if the spin‑off does not qual‑
